<p class=first>
	Made a simple die holder for the lathe that was seen on GadgetBuilder.com.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Die holder plan.jpg" alt="Die holder plan" width="1144" height="958">

<p>
	Began with a 2 1/8" X 1 1/2" steel round stock. Faced both ends and finished the 
	outside with a light cut. One end was center drilled and drilled with a 1/4" drill 
	bit. This was followed with a 3/8" bit and then a 1/2" bit. A 1" diameter hole was 
	bored in one end to a depth of 5/16" deep to hold small dies.
</p>

<p class=note>
	A boring bar from the purchased set did not work well using the quick change tool 
	holder. Either it is too flexible or the boring bar is not sharp. Over many years of 
	attempting to use these bars I have concluded that they are not sharp, but can be 
	sharpened.
</p>

<p>
	The drilled hole needed to be slightly larger than 1/2" so it was bored from both 
	ends with the Sherline boring bar/holder. 
</p>

<p>
	The aluminum shaft was faced and cleaned up on the sides for a good fit. One end was 
	turned down to 3/8" for 1" (to fit in the large drill chuck). The die holding end was 
	center drilled and drilled with a #21 drill bit for the holding screw. It was tapped 
	with a 10-32 tap. 
</p>

<p>
	Purchased some new dies that are 13/16" in diameter. Bored a hole in the opposite end 
	from the first to 0.815" which is a good fit on the new dies. This hole was bored to 
	0.275" deep. The holder was clamped in a vee block on the mill table. The end and 
	side were located to set the spindle on center and 0.137" in from the end. A hole 
	was drilled to #36 and tapped with a 6/32 tap.
