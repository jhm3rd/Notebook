<p class=first>
	Decided to make a name plate/plaque for the inside lid of the machinist's tool 
	chest. My name, the year of construction, and maybe a couple of scrolls will 
	comprise the engraving. A 1&nbsp;5/8" X 3" rectangle of 1/16" brass was cut out 
	and cleaned up including sanding to 1000 grit. This was marked out for holes in 
	each of the corners 3/16" in from the sides. The holes were center drilled and 
	drilled for #2 clearance with a #37 (0.104") drill.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some potential fonts from google to use on the name plate: Charm, Tangerine, 
	Niconne, and Felipa.

	I prefer the first two: "Charm" and "Tangerine". "Charm" looks more like a font 
	to use on a machinist's tool chest. And best of all it looks relatively simple 
	from an engraving perspective. I printed out a screen capture of Charm at 66% 
	to get a size corresponding to what is seen on the web page. I then attempted a 
	transfer using the purchased transfer paper. The transferred graphite was very 
	faint even with significant pressure and multiple traces, though the letters 
	looked good. I will try it on china white next.

	The process works really well transferring onto China White. Prior to engraving 
	I sharpened the graver using the fixture from Lindsay Tools. I first used 600 grit 
	paper on a 1/2" thick piece of plywood and followed this with 1000 grit on the 
	same plywood. Finally, I used the purchased diamond stone to give a final polish. 
	The flats were also polished with the diamond stone. Before engraving the plate 
	I decided to practice engraving letters a bit. I am going to need significant 
	practice before I am ready to start engraving the plate!!
</p>

<p>
	Decided to complete the plate today, June 11. The name was engraved using the new 
	engraver's vise. It is quite nice and minimizes the need to engrave from awkward 
	directions. The year of construction, 2018, was then laid out on china white below 
	the name. It was engraved as well. A few burrs were removed and then the plate 
	was sanded with 400, 600, and 1000 grit paper. It was buffed on a wheel with red 
	buffing compound. The buffing compound was washed off with soap and water with 
	the help of a soft scrub brush. Two coats of spray lacquer were applied to minimize 
	tarnishing.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Had some difficulties with spraying the lacquer. It seemed wavy as opposed to 
	smooth and it was not uniform, so it was sanded off and a second attempt was 
	made. This time the first coat was smooth, but the second was slightly wavy. At 
	least it was a uniform finish. So I stopped at this point.
</p>

<p>
	The name plate was centered on the inside of the lid. Four holes were marked. A 
	punch was pressed into each mark. The 1/4" long screws were then used to mount 
	the plate to the box. It took a lot of force to make a hole sufficiently deep to 
	start the tiny screws. The pictures below show the result.
