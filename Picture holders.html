<p class=first>
	Rhea was having difficulty finding picture holders for two small 3"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3" 
	pictures from Sylvia (of her wedding to Herman). I offered to make a pair. Rhea liked 
	the idea of a pedestal style and preferred aluminum to wood or brass. I found a 3" 
	length of 1&nbsp;1/2" aluminum hex.
</p>

<p>
	The aluminum bar stock was held in the horizontal band saw using a machinist's jack 
	to keep the vise jaw from racking. The saw gave a nice cut, though not perfectly 
	square with the sides.
</p>

<img class=inline src="picHold/PH saw cut.jpg" alt="Two parts cut from aluminum hex" width="1749" height="1239">

<p>
	Each part was squared in the three jaw chuck on the Sherline lathe using a dial 
	indicator. It was too cold to work in the garage and use the South Bend lathe. The 
	ends were faced square with one another and with the sides of the hex. Both parts 
	ended up 1&nbsp;15/32" long. They are shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="picHold/PH faced.jpg" alt="The two future picture holders faced" width="1695" height="1356">

<p class="note">
	While facing the two parts a ticking sound was heard coming from the lathe. At first 
	I only heard it while the lathe was running and was unable to find the source. The 
	jaws were not extended sufficiently to be hitting anything. After some time I was 
	able to get it to make the sound when rotating the spindle by hand. Then I noticed 
	the drive pulley had a slight movement relative to the spindle. I tightened a set 
	screw holding the pulley to the spindle and the noise vanished.
</p>

<p>
	The shape was laid out with the French template on a piece of graph paper. Four cuts 
	were sketched out to get close to the desired shape. The part was held in the lathe 
	after positioning with 1/16" sheets of brass shim. The first cut after turning it 
	round reduced the part to 1&nbsp;1/4" for 1&nbsp;3/32". The second cut further 
	reduced 1&nbsp;1/32" to 1" diameter. The third cut dropped the diameter to 3/4" for 
	27/32" and the last reduced the last 21/32" to 1/2". The part at this stage is shown 
	below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="picHold/PH step cut.jpg" alt="The hex part step cut to rough shape" width="1795" height="1729">

<p>
	The next two hours were spent filing with a half round file and sanding with 100 grit 
	paper to bring the part to final shape. This was way too much work. The step cuts 
	should be significantly finer on the second holder. The pictures below document the 
	process.
</p>

<img class=inline src="picHold/PH sanding 1.jpg" alt="The part sanded to rough shape" width="1698" height="1863">

<p>
	Spent the morning sanding. The holder was sanded in the lathe up to 1000 grit. The 
	sides were sanded after removing from the lathe up to 600 grit. The holder was 
	held in the mill vise and a slot was cut on center 0.375" deep with a 1/8" end mill. 
	The slot was widened to 0.150". (The pictures are 0.145" thick.) The burrs were 
	removed with a small flat file. The holder at this stage is shown below. 
</p>

<p>
	The holder is not very effective. The picture can be balanced in the holder, but it 
	doesn't take much for it to fall out. The holder is also probably not heavy enough. 
	A wider design might have been more effective. It holds the picture vertically, 
	which is fine if the picture is at eye level. At least I don't need to make a second. 
	I will need to find a way to repurpose the thing. Maybe a rook for a large chessboard. 
</p>

<p>
	I couldn't leave well enough alone. I suggested using a set screw to hold the picture 
	more firmly. Rhea liked the idea. I milled a flat on one side of the top with a 1/8" 
	end mill. A #36 drill was used to drill a hole, followed by tapping 6-32. The picture 
	is after polishing the picture holder with white rouge on a cloth wheel.
</p>

<p>
	Sylvia said she like the picture holder after Rhea sent her the picture above. I need 
	to find a better way to cut the curve more closely to the line and minimize filing 
	time. After studying the code for the calculation tool, 
	<a href="Round groove cutting.html">Round Groove Cutting</a> it is clear that it can 
	be generalized to Bézier curves by changing one function, 
	getDepthOfCut(width,radius,fileBuffer). This function calculates the depth of cut, y, 
	or radius - offset. I just need to substitute a function for the desired curve.
</p>

<p>
	From the <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#aligning">Bézier curve tutorial</a> 
	with control points, (57,220), (59,145), (143,88), & (206,96), the following two 
	equations define the offset, x, and the depth of cut, y.

	In order to solve for y given x, t has to be found given x and then substituted into 
	the equation for y. An easier method is to make a table of x and their corresponding 
	y values. The depth of cut can be looked up given x. Some experimentation should 
	determine how many data points from t = 0 to t = 1 are required for the table. The 
	screenshot below shows the curve as represented in Grapher.
</p>

<img class=inline src="picHold/PH Bezier graph.png" alt="A graph of the desired Bezier curve" width="2086" height="1202">

<p class="note">
	The calculator that uses the four control points from a Bézier curve to provide the 
	correct cutting pattern is called <a href="Tools/Bezier groove cutting.html">Bézier 
	Groove Cutting</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The calculator is functioning, but the output needs further modification to be 
	useful. I am also not sure the output is correct. I pasted the output into a 
	spreadsheet and after some minor changes graphed it. The curve looked good. However, 
	when I used the data to cut the part the cut just looked like a 45&deg; angle. In 
	any event the part was filed to shape somewhat quicker than the previous version. 
	Like its predecessor it was sanded to 1000 grit and polished. It was grooved to a 
	depth of 0.375, drilled and tapped for the 6-32 set screw. It was deburred. The 
	first picture shows the step cut part followed by a picture of the filed part.

	Both parts were washed with soap and water, rinsed with water, rinsed with acetone 
	and painted with Protecta-Clear. A second coat was applied after one hour. A hexagonal 
	piece of green felt was cut out and glued (Elmers) to the bottom of each picture 
	holder.

	Turns out the pictures were made for Sylvia by my niece Rachel. Sylvia really liked 
	the two picture holders.
