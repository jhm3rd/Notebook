<p class=first>
	I decided to make another project from J. Randolph Bulgin's "Puzzles and Peculiarities 
	from the Machine Shop". It is called the keyhole cube. Eight cubes of brass and 
	aluminum have keyholes cut in one or two sides. One or two sides also have 'keys' 
	attached. All eight cubes are unique. It is a puzzle requiring disassembly and 
	assembly. His assembled cube is shown below. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC picture.jpg" alt="The keyhole cube from the book" width="2080" height="2140">

<p>
	Two one foot long 1.25" square bars of metal were ordered. They arrived yesterday.
	Looking at the bars this morning revealed that the brass bar was smaller than the 
	aluminum bar. Sure enough it is 1.125" square. I was just about to mail Online 
	Metals with my gripe, when I looked at the order. I ordered the brass in a slightly 
	smaller size! I don't think the size matters as long as the two bars are the same. 
	I guess I will be removing more aluminum than I expected.
</p>

<p>
	Four cubes of each metal are required. At 1&nbsp;1/8" square I need a 5" long bar. 
	That gives me 1/2" of material for the cuts to separate the cubes. I will use the 
	newly renovated band saw to cut the metal. We will see if it performs as well as it 
	did on the test cut. Beautiful cuts, not perfectly square. I need to move the 
	adjustable rollers in closer to the work.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC rough bars.jpg" alt="Rough bars cut from the blanks" width="1866" height="1482">

<p>
	The brass bar is exactly 1.125" square. I plan to only sand the four outside faces. 
	The aluminum needs to be milled. It is 1.252" square. I will mill 1/16" off of all 
	four faces, so they are all pristine. I started with the fly cutter. I was only able 
	to remove 0.005" in a pass. And that had to be taken very slowly. I will reserve 
	the fly cutter for the finish cut. The South Bend lathe will be used to reduce the 
	aluminum to 1.140" or so. 
</p>

<p>
	The block of aluminum was chucked in the four jaw chuck. It was turned at 300 rpm. 
	The cuts went smoothly, throwing chips everywhere. One side had already been cut 
	with the fly cutter, so only three sides were cut. The block of aluminum was returned 
	to the mill and the fly cutter was used to clean the three lathe cut faces. The 
	dimensions across the square cross section were reduced to 1.125"&nbsp;&plusmn;0.002".
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC aluminum bar.jpg" alt="The flycut aluminum bar" width="1764" height="1586">

<p>
	Measure once and cut twice. Now I need to shrink the cubes even further. I am  
	shooting for 1" cubes. A 1/4" end mill was too slow and may be dull. Switched to a 
	3/8" end mill. The cutting was much smoother, but back and forth across a cube face 
	takes too long. Switched to the lathe. Works well. Requires a fly cutter afterward 
	to produce a really nice face. It is difficult getting the cube square in the vise 
	jaws with the aluminum protectors. The aluminum cubes were reduced to almost one inch 
	on the South Bend lathe. I started reducing the size of the brass cubes on the 
	Sherline. It takes longer than the South Bend as expected. Switched to the South Bend 
	and the brass cubes were reduced to slightly over 1.000", so the sides could finished 
	with the fly cutter. Most of the cubes were finished with the fly cutter. When there 
	was too little material to remove they were sanded up to 400 grit.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC cubes cleaned up.jpg" alt="Eight cubes flycut or sanded" width="1947" height="1408">

<p>
	Each of the one inch cubes becomes a unique piece of the puzzle. Each has at least 
	one button and at least one keyed slot. There are three face modifications on each 
	cube. They occupy three adjacent faces. I will use the common corner as a reference 
	for each modification. The corner with the three emanating edges closest to 
	perpendicularity was selected and marked for each of the eight cubes. The three faces 
	of the cubes were then marked for button or keyway as shown in the photo below. A 
	problem raised its ugly head. The cubes are 1" and the keyway cutter is 1/2"!
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC cubes marked.jpg" alt="Reference corner and faces marked" width="1523" height="1983">

<p>
	There are three steps to milling the keyhole. The cube is repeatably secured in the 
	vise and a 0.50" hole is drilled/milled into the cube 0.250" off of center. A 1/4" 
	end mill is inserted and the slot is cut so the center of the end mill aligns with 
	the center of the face. The resulting bump on the side of the circle is 1/8" deep. 
	The keyway is then cut with careful attention to chip removal.
</p>
	
<p>	
	All of the buttons are centered on the face. The buttons are screwed onto a #10-32 
	stud screwed into the hole in the face. A repeatable setup is required to drill and 
	tap the holes precisely in the center. The buttons themselves are mushroom shaped. 
	They are 0.220" high. The cap is 0.120" high and 0.490" in diameter. The stem is 
	0.100" high and 0.240" in diameter. The stem is drilled and tapped for the #10-32 
	stud.
</p>

<p class="note">
	A smaller keyhole cutter was located on the internet. One can be purchased from a 
	Japanese company, Misumi, in many metric sizes. A 10 mm (0.408") cutter with 3 mm 
	(0.118") flute depth is $41.33 before shipping. Misumi has many warehouses in the US. 
	Alternatively, I can try to make one from HSS. 
</p>

<p>
	The Misume keyhole cutter described above arrived yesterday. I am excited to get back 
	to this project. Before milling I need to map out the new dimensions of the slots and 
	the buttons. As measured the new keyhole cutter is 0.398" in diameter. The height 
	of the cutting edges is 0.117". I don't know if my diameter measurement is somehow 
	incorrect. The buttons will be made to fit.
</p>

<p>
	The process of milling the keyhole was first tried out on a scrap of aluminum. It 
	was held in the vise and the edge and center were found. The table was moved 0.263" 
	to put the spindle on center above the desired location. A hole was drilled with a 
	center drill followed by a 3/16" drill to a depth of 0.179". The hole was then 
	opened with a 3/8" drill (dull!). A 3/16" end mill was used to mill a slot that 
	is 0.237" from the site of the drilled hole. The keyhole cutter was then used to 
	open the keyhole and produce the slot. The shaft on the keyhole cutter is 10 mm, 
	so a drill chuck was used to hold it. Drilling down went easily as a minimal amount 
	of material was removed. Cutting the slot was straightforward, but slow. The slot 
	was cut until the cutter reached the end of the slot milled earlier. The photo shows 
	the milled keyhole.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC trial.jpg" alt="Trying out the keyhole cutter on a scrap" width="1675" height="1849">

<p class="note">
	This was very difficult without a DRO. Even milling the slot with the 3/16" end mill 
	was difficult as the the rotations of the handle had to be counted in both directions, 
	while managing the backlash. In retrospect I don't believe the slot was cut far 
	enough by about 0.050". A poor man's DRO is needed!
</p>

<p>
	Simple enough to do if only one axis needs to be tracked as in this case. I remembered 
	the vise-lock pliers on a clamp attached to a shelf in the garage. They were being 
	used to hang my face shield. Now they have a real use. The bar for tramming was 
	screwed to the dial gauge. This bar was clamped in the vise-lock pliers. The C-clamp 
	was attached to the board holding the mill. This gave solid locks from the gauge to 
	the table. Very positive movement on the gauge as the table is moved on the y-axis.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Poor man's DRO 2.jpg" alt="The poor man's DRO'" width="1805" height="2471">

<p>
	Followed the same procedure with a 1" aluminum cube. The vise was first checked to 
	make sure it was aligned with the x-axis. It was almost perfect! The block was slid 
	to the right in the vise until it was butted against a parallel held against the jaws. 
	The right edge was located and the spindle was shifted to center. The back edge was 
	located and the spindle was advanced on the y-axis 0.263". 
</p>
	
<p>
	The only real challenge was drilling the hole to 3/8". Before using the drills they 
	were stoned by hand. There was still tremendous chatter with the 3/8" drill and the 
	table shifted about 0.015" on the x-axis! The x-axis was locked. This only affected 
	milling the 3/16" slot and it was widened at the correct setting at the end. The 
	keyhole cutter worked fine. The cutting was stopped a few times and the cutter backed 
	out in order to blow out the chips. The following shot is an attempt to show the 
	inside of the keyhole while the part is still in the vise.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Stopped to make a collet to hold the 0.398" keyhole cutter. An overly large scrap of 
	aluminum was turned down to 1.5" for 1.125". A 3/8" hole was drilled about 0.5" deep. 
	This hole was then bored to 0.703" in preparation for cutting threads 0.047" deep. 
	The threads were cut, but unfortunately a gear came loose about halfway. The resulting 
	threads are less than spectacular. The fit on the headstock is acceptable. After 
	removing the part from the chuck and screwing it onto the headstock the end was faced 
	and drilled to 3/8". It was bored to a good fit on the 10 mm keyhole cutter. The 
	end was tapered 20&deg;. The collet was drilled with a #21 drill and then tapped 10-32. 
	Three photos below document the process: bored, threaded, and completed.

<p>
	The second slot was cut this morning. It was on the opposite side of the block from 
	the reference corner, so the dial gauge had to be moved. Everything went well 
	including the drilling with a sharp 3/8" drill. The entire process is quite noisy so 
	I stopped after completing only one more slot. I will work tomorrow morning, when 
	Rhea is teaching dancing in the garage. The photo below shows the first aluminum 
	block that just needs to be drilled and tapped for the button.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC two slots.jpg" alt="Two slots completed in the first cube" width="1585" height="1688">

<p>
	All five keyhole slots were prepared similarly in the aluminum. One slot was milled 
	too far with the 3/16" end mill. An aluminum rod 3/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.190" was put 
	in the end of the slot with a little Loctite. After drying the slot was milled to 
	the correct dimensions. Unfortunately, the block came loose during the milling 
	producing an obvious flaw!! (Slot in the back left corner.)
</p>

<p>
	The brass was next with seven keyhole slots to make. Three were made this morning. 
	All proceeded well. The brass seems to be more forgiving than the aluminum. Finished 
	the rest on the following morning. The photo below shows the seven keyhole slots in 
	the brass cubes.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC seven slots.jpg" alt="Seven slots completed in the brass cubes" width="1649" height="1602">

<p>
	Drilling and tapping a dozen holes was next on the agenda. The marked edges of the 
	blocks were located and the spindle centered over the block. The block was center 
	drilled, drilled with a #21 drill, chamfered, and tapped 10-32. The first seven 
	drilled and partially tapped holes are seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC seven holes.jpg" alt="Seven holes drilled and tapped" width="1870" height="1828">

<p>
	The last five holes were drilled and tapped the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. All 
	twelve drilled and tapped holes are seen in the picture below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC twelve holes.jpg" alt="Twelve holes drilled and tapped" width="1954" height="1395">

<p>
	The current plan for making the buttons is to make them in one piece on the lathe. 
	The threads will be 0.25" long followed by an undercut, a 0.185" diameter neck, and 
	the button 0.395" in diameter and 0.115" thick. The neck should be about 1/16" long, 
	but the exact length will await some experimentation.
</p>

<p>
	The first button was made and tested. The screw is slightly too long and the thickness 
	of the button needs to be reduced. Production mode was started this morning. Bronze 
	was used (1/2" rod) as that is what I have. A two inch length was cut off and placed 
	in the three jaw chuck. It was faced and the diameter was reduced to 0.395" for 
	0.5" length. The first 5/16" was further reduced to 0.188". Thread relief was cut 
	with two passes of the parting tool. Not really thread relief as the depth is only 
	0.005". But the relief is needed to fit in the slots. The end of the part was 
	chamfered and the part was threaded 10-32. The button/screw was parted off at about 
	0.36". This was repeated 11 times. It was then necessary to adjust some of the 
	dimensions. Mostly the thickness of the button needed reduction. The parts were held 
	in the collet and trimmed up as needed to the following button dimensions: 
	0.100""&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.395". The buttons at this stage are shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC twelve buttons.jpg" alt="Twelve buttons finished except for screw length" width="1381" height="1090">

<p class="note">
	Caution!!! Spoiler Alert Below!!!
</p>

<p>
	The next step is setting the length of the screws. There is enough variation that 
	each screw needs to be fit for its hole and for the button in the other block. That 
	requires me to know which blocks are mated. I used a picture of the two halves of 
	the puzzle in the book to decipher the order of the blocks. This is shown below after 
	numbering the blocks. I discovered that one of the aluminum blocks needs to have its 
	slot remilled as none of the buttons fit in that slot.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC blocks ordered.jpg" alt="Eight blocks in their appropriate positions" width="2117" height="1789">

<p>
	The aluminum block with the bad slot was placed in the vise. The slot cutter was 
	centered above the hole and lowered until it just touched bottom. It was then moved 
	forward into the slot. A bit of material was removed. After removing the slot cutter 
	a button easily slid into the slot. Most of the buttons stuck part way into the slots. 
	This was because the neck diameter was too large for the slot opening. The buttons 
	were returned to the collet in the lathe and the neck was reduced over 0.08-0.10" 
	with the parting tool in two or three passes. All of the buttons now fit in the slots.
</p>

<p>
	In order to reduce the length of the screws, the buttons needed to be held in the 
	three-jaw chuck. A spider was made for the three jaw. A scrap from a failed gear was 
	used. Three lines were marked at 120&deg; increments by eye. A circle was scratched 
	with the scrap in the lathe about 3/16" from center. Three holes were drilled through 
	at the intersections of the lines with a 0.150" drill. Six lines were sketched from 
	the outside to the sides of each hole. A hacksaw was used to make cuts down these 
	lines to the holes. After some cleanup the lathe spider was finished. Pretty rough, 
	but works well.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC lathe spider.jpg" alt="A lathe spider for the three jaw chuck" width="2221" height="1760">

<p>
	The blocks were all aligned and further marked so the buttons could be tailored for 
	each individual pair of buttons/slots. A button was screwed into a hole. The button 
	was inserted into its matching slot. The gap between blocks was approximated with 
	feeler gauges. The button was then placed in the lathe against the spider and the 
	measured amount was removed from the end of the screw. A nut was placed on the screw 
	before reducing to clean up the threads. This was later found to be unnecessary as a 
	10-32 die worked more efficiently. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC spider & button.jpg" alt="A button held against the lathe spider in the three jaw chuck" width="1514" height="1202">

<p>
	After all of the buttons were fitted to their mating slots the entire cube could be 
	assembled. Two buttons required further adjustment. Fitting the final four buttons 
	into their mating four slots was straightforward, but pushing the cubes into their 
	final positions is tight. I will leave it this way. One, the cube stays together. 
	Two, it is a little more difficult to determine how to get the two halves apart.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC assembled cube.jpg" alt="First assembly of the cube from the eight parts" width="1374" height="1519">

<p>
	The cubes were polished starting with the brass cubes. The three outer faces were
	sanded from 400 to 2000 grit. The three faces on each cube were then polished with 
	red rouge. The first two polished cubes are shown below. The remaining two brass cubes 
	were polished as well after the same sanding process. You can just tell in the cube 
	on the right that I am struggling with polishing. The edges of that cube are fine, 
	but the center is still slightly cloudy!? I polished the center for some time and 
	can't seem to get rid of the cloudiness.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC polished brass.jpg" alt="First two cubes polished on three faces" width="1164" height="1188">

<p>
	Three sides of the aluminum cubes were sanded from 400 to 2000 grit. They were then 
	polished with white rouge. I got a better finish with the aluminum. The four edges of 
	each face were polished and the face center was polished from all four directions. A 
	new charge of rouge was added prior to each face. The eight polished cubes are 
	shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC polished cubes.jpg" alt="All eight cubes painted with clear coat" width="2282" height="1524">

<p>
	The polished faces were neutralized with a weak NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution. The cubes 
	were rinsed with water and wiped with acetone on a paper towel. The polished faces 
	were then painted with the Protecta-Clear. After drying they were painted with a 
	second coat. The cubes after one coat are seen in the next photo. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/KC painted cubes.jpg" alt="First coat of clear coat on all cubes" width="2182" height="1205">

<p>
	The Sharpie marks were wiped off with a little acetone after letting the clear coat 
	dry overnight. The buttons were removed one at a time, a drop of Loctite was placed 
	in the threaded hole, the buttons were screwed back in place. A photo of the 
	assembled cube is shown below alongside a photo of the eight completed sub-cubes. Ran 
	into trouble putting it together after gluing the buttons in place. One aluminum 
	cube was just too tight. After lengthening the slot in its mating brass cube as the 
	aluminum cube did not want to go deep enough there was still a barrier. The top of 
	the slot was then reduced and now the cubes go together smoothly.
