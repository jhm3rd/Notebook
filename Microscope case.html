<p class=first>
	After <a href="Microscope restoration.html">restoring the microscope</a>, purchasing 
	a light and slides a case was needed. The microscope is approximately 
	5"&nbsp;X&nbsp;7"&nbsp;X&nbsp;12". After looking at a few cases online a plan was 
	sketched out. The inner dimensions of the case are 6"&nbsp;X&nbsp;11"&nbsp;X&nbsp;13". 
	1/2" lumber was purchased. These boards are approximately 3&nbsp;1/2" wide. Two 
	boards will be glued to make the deep sides. Three drawers are planned as well. One 
	will hold the light. One is for the slides, coverslips, and stains. The last is for 
	any additional lenses or filters purchased.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC case idea.jpg" alt="The inspiration for the case" width="1856" height="2048">

<p>
	The top and bottom will be 6&nbsp;3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;12". Four boards were cut to 
	12&nbsp;1/2". Similarly, the sides will be 6"&nbsp;X&nbsp;13". Four 13&nbsp;1/2" 
	boards were cut for the sides. The door will be 12"&nbsp;X&nbsp;13". It will be 
	made in a frame and panel style. The outer frame members were cut: two at 13&nbsp;1/2" 
	and two at 12&nbsp;1/2".
</p>

<p>
	Mating edges were decided for the top, bottom and sides. These edges were planed. 
	During the plane rehab course a trick was discussed of planing the center portion of 
	an edge (leaving an inch at either end unplaned). In this fashion only one clamp is 
	needed in the center of a pair of boards. An attempt was made to plane the center of 
	one board of a pair, but I had little success attempting this. The planed edges did, 
	however, fit well. The first two pairs of boards were glued up at 8 am. Only two can 
	be glued at a time, as there are only four clamps available. The photo shows the 
	glue-up.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC glue up.jpg" alt="Edge gluing two boards to make a wider board" width="2317" height="2304">

<p>
	The second pairs were glued up an hour later. After a few hours the clamps were 
	removed. All four glue-ups were allowed to dry for two days. The majority of the glue 
	squeeze-out was removed with a chisel. Only one of the four boards was even across 
	the joint. After trying many things the easiest way to fix this was by sanding 
	with 40 grit paper using the oscillating sander. This left the four boards ready for 
	cutting to size.
</p>

<p>
	The planned inside depth is 6&nbsp;3/4". The current width of the boards is 
	7&nbsp;1/16". The back needs to sit in a 1/4" dado. The dado will be 1/8" from the 
	back edges. This leaves the inside depth at 6&nbsp;11/16". Close enough. All four 
	sides of the box need one end squared up and then cut to length. The two sides need 
	1/2" removed from the front side for the inset door.
</p>

<p>
	One edge of each board was squared up with the crosscut sled on the table saw. The 
	boards were cut to length, two at 12" and two at 13" using a stop. The two long 
	boards, sides, had 1/2" sawed off a long edge. The outside faces were marked. 
</p>

<p>
	The thickness of the back was measured at 3/16". The minimal thickness of the dado 
	set is 1/4". The adjustable dado  was used with the standard blade. The #2 setting 
	was too wide, so the #1 setting was used. The blade was set to 1/4" height and the 
	fence was set at 1/8" from the blade. After two practice cuts the dados were cut on 
	the inside faces. Due to the marked curve across two of the boards the dado is at 
	some ends less than 1/4" deep. The back will need to be cut smaller than the plan 
	might indicate at 11&nbsp;1/2""&nbsp;X&nbsp;13&nbsp;1/2"".
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC dadoes.jpg" alt="Dadoes cut in all four boards" width="1927" height="2468">

<p>
	Before the box is assembled the back has to be cut and all parts sanded. The back was 
	cut to 11&nbsp;3/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;13&nbsp;3/8". It fits within the dadoes leaving the 
	desired internal dimensions. All five parts were sanded with 220 grit paper.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC mockup.jpg" alt="The parts all arranged in place to form the box" width="2569" height="2686">

<p>
	A line was drawn 3/16" from the short ends of both top and bottom box parts. Cross 
	hatches were drawn across the lines at 1&nbsp;3/8", four per end. The layout lines 
	were punched. Using the #6 wood screw drill guide holes were drilled at each of these 
	locations. Care was taken to drill the chamfers to the same depth. After drilling all 
	sixteen holes the hole was widened to a through hole for a #6 screw. (Only the 
	bottom of the hole needed this treatment.) A side was clamped to the top. The hole 
	in the top was used to guide the drill for a hole in the side. A screw was inserted. 
	The second hole was visible above the clamp, so it was also drilled and a screw 
	inserted. The clamp was removed and the other two holes were drilled and screwed. 
	This was repeated on the other end of the top, but was suspended when the drill ran 
	out of power.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC screwing.jpg" alt="Screwing the side to the top via the predrilled holes" width="2207" height="1856">

<p>
	The remainder of the screws were installed on the top and bottom. The completed case 
	body is shown in the two photos below.
</p>

<p>
	The opening for the door is 12"&nbsp;X&nbsp;13" and is reasonably square. The height 
	is slightly larger than 13", so a 13" door will leave some space for movement. The 
	door will be a panel and frame construction. The frame will be mitered and the inside 
	edges will sport a dado for the panel. The boards were all mitered at 45&deg; on one 
	end. They were measured and marked for the other end and mitered to length. The fit 
	was a little off, as expected. The inner edges of the joint were filed to achieve a 
	better fit, seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC door frame.jpg" alt="The door frame parts aligned" width="1921" height="2015">

<p>
	The dado washer set was again used with the fence set 1/16" from the blade. This 
	gave a centered dado to fit the panel, shown in the photo below. The panel was cut to 
	5&nbsp;3/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;6&nbsp;3/8". The photo shows how the parts fit.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC door dry.jpg" alt="The door parts dry assembled" width="1952" height="1976">

<p>
	Clamping was challenging. Only three of the bar clamps fit, so a pipe clamp had to 
	be used. The door was assembled on top of triangular bars. Wood was used as needed 
	to protect the door from the clamps. The biggest challenge, beyond getting the clamps 
	properly adjusted, was keeping the door frames flat. This was partially accomplished. 
	A lot of sanding is in store. The photo shows the glue-up. The clamps were removed
	after two hours. The door does not quite fit as one corner was not pulled together 
	(upper left). It shouldn't take much to make it fit.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC door unclamped.jpg" alt="The door out from the clamps" width="1841" height="1903">

<p class="note">
	A magnetic catch for the door was the initial plan. I have reconsidered. Something 
	more positive is needed in case the case were to fall over. Right now a hook seems 
	like the best choice.
</p>

<p>
	The door was sanded first with 120 grit on the oscillating sander. This did a pretty 
	good job leveling the corners. The front was done as completely as possibility. Glue 
	was used to fill in the cracks during sanding. 220 grit was done by hand. The edges 
	were sanded and all sharp corners were sanded round. The fit showed one corner off 
	by less than a 1/16". The door was clamped to the front of the workbench and the 
	offending corner was planed. This led to an almost perfect as seen in the photo 
	below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC door in place.jpg" alt="The door sanded, planed, and set in place" width="1949" height="2149">

<p>
	Before finishing the outside of the case needs more sanding. The case was sanded all 
	over again with 220 grit using the oscillating sander. The dust was removed. The 
	case was stained with the General Finishes 7 parts orange to 4 parts med brown combo 
	used on the Greene and Greene side table. The stained box and door are seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC stained.jpg" alt="The door and box stained" width="1991" height="1947">

<p>
	The water based stain really raised the grain. More sanding was needed than expected. 
	This left the stain washed out in places, a more antique look than planned. The stain 
	will be left to dry overnight before applying shellac.
</p>

<p>
	Three coats of shellac were wiped on this morning. The parts were sanded before the 
	first coat and after each coat. The coats were left to dry for one hour before 
	applying the next. As usual I am not thrilled with the finish, but it is sufficient 
	for this rather workmanlike box.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC shellacking.jpg" alt="The door and box after three coats of shellac" width="1799" height="2262">

<p>
	Hanging the door was next. To this end the hinge locations were laid out. Three 
	hinges were used. The hinge on center was marked out with my <a href:="Marking knives.html">
	marking knives</a>. The center of the box was supported with some scrap wood. The 
	marked rectangle was mortised with a chisel to the depth of the hinge. The other two 
	hinges were aligned 2" from the outside of the box. They were mortised similarly. 
	The photo shows the mortises with one hinge in place.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC hinge mortises.jpg" alt="The hinge mortises in the box body" width="2195" height="2337">

<p>
	The three hinges were installed after marking the hole locations and drilling them 
	with a 1/16" drill. The door was aligned with the box body and held in place. The 
	center hinge was marked with the marking knives. A chisel was used to make the 
	mortise. The other two hinges were marked out and their mortises chiseled out. These 
	mortises extended across the entire 1/2" width of the door. The hole locations 
	were marked and drilled. The three hinges were attached to the door. The first photo 
	shows the three installed hinges. The second shows the open box. The door fit is 
	perfect.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC open door.jpg" alt="The door open" width="2142" height="1816">

<p class="note">
	The red oak was not a great choice for making this box. The grain is too open. It is 
	almost impossible to sand smooth as some of the grain is much softer than others. 
	The resulting finish is rough. The grain also takes up stain very non-uniformly. 
	The box looks like zebra hide.
</p>

<p>
	Various options were considered for latching the box closed. The option settled on 
	is using a pin inserted in a hole in the top of the box that extends into the door. 
	This is simple and effective. A chain is needed to attach the pin to the box.
</p>

<p>
	While considering the closure and the handle the boxes inside need to be made. The 
	first box, the largest, will hold the light fixture. This box will fit in the upper 
	left corner of the case. There is plenty of room so the box was made 
	4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;6"&nbsp;X&nbsp;7". A scrap of 3/8" plywood was found. It was cut 
	into four sides: two 4&nbsp;X&nbsp;7" and two 4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;5&nbsp;3/4". The 
	joinery is simple butt joints for the sides. The top and bottom are to be inset into 
	these sides. Two 5&nbsp;3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;6&nbsp;3/4" rectangles were cut from 3/16" 
	plywood.
</p>

<p>
	Rabbets were cut for on the long edges of all four sides. The saw blade was set at 
	1/4" and the blade was set 3/16" from the fence. The pieces were all assembled. The 
	top and bottom needed to be recut a bit less than the nominal 5&nbsp;3/4". When the 
	fit was acceptable, glue was applied and the parts were assembled. The photo shows 
	the glue-up. (The loose clamp is serving as weight for the box top.)
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC light box glue.jpg" alt="The light box glue-up" width="1752" height="1541">

<p>
	The table saw fence was adjusted until about one third of the box was beyond the 
	blade. The box was cut on all four sides and separated into a top and a bottom as 
	seen in the first photo below. All sides of the box were sanded to 220 grit. The 
	dust was removed. The first coat of tung oil was applied with a shop cloth. The 
	box at this stage is seen in the second photo.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC light box cut.jpg" alt="The light box cut into a top and a bottom" width="1570" height="1752">
<img class=inline src="microCase/MC light box tung.jpg" alt="The light box sanded and with one coat of tung oil" width="1953" height="2105">

<p>
	Two more coats of tung oil were applied; sanding between coats. After drying a hinge 
	was located. It is really too big for this box. Since no screws will fit the hinge 
	and not go through the 3/8" box wall, glue was chosen to affix the hinge. The hinge 
	was centered on the edge of the bottom box. It was outlined with marking knives. The 
	area marked was chiseled out down to the second layer of plywood. The boxes were 
	clamped together. The hinge location was marked on the box top. This was chiseled 
	out. The opening was not large enough to fit the hinge with the top tight to the 
	bottom. The opening on the bottom was opened up a bit. The hinge fit well, so it 
	was glued in place with two part epoxy. The first picture shows the hinge set in the 
	glue. I was sufficiently careful applying the glue that the box opens and the hinge 
	flexes.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC hinge open.jpg" alt="The light box hinge functioning without glue binding" width="1562" height="1979">

<p>
	The opposite side of the box was marked for the hook "eye". The box was drilled 3/32" 
	and the holes chamfered. Two screws with their point filed off held the eye. The hook 
	was aligned above the eye and marked. A hole was drilled. A #6 washer was used to 
	raise the hook enough to clear the ends of the eye. The hook was screwed into place 
	as seen below. The light and its trappings easily fit in the box.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC light in box.jpg" alt="The light in the box" width="2304" height="2296">

<p>
	Slight error in calculations. The size of the box did not account for the two newly 
	installed protrusions. The light box fits nicely in the corner next to the microscope 
	as planned. However, the door no longer shuts all the way. There is a 1/4" gap when 
	the door hits the latch.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC door gap.jpg" alt="The light box preventing the door from shutting" width="2010" height="1936">

<p>
	The hinge is also protruding. There is enough leeway in the fit to accomodate the 
	hinge, but not both it and the latch. The latch will be moved to the side, seen on 
	top in the picture above. The latch was moved. Three plugs were made for the holes.
	A short length of 3/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/4" walnut was held in the four jaw chuck. 5/16" 
	was reduced to 1/4" and 1/4" was further reduced to 3/16". The little plug was parted 
	off at 5/16". The part was held by the 3/16" end in a collet and the head was 
	rounded with a file and sanded. Two more were made similarly. The holes were opened 
	with a 0.180" drill and then reamed to 0.188". The plugs were glued into the holes 
	and a drop of shellac was put on the heads.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC holes plugged.jpg" alt="The light box holes plugged" width="1346" height="1285">

<p>
	Two stops were made for the inside of the case. The first is for the base of the 
	microscope, a rectangle with one end round. The second is just a strip along the 
	bottom of the case to hold the light box in place. The microscope stop was made 
	from a scrap of 1/2" oak. It was cut to 4&nbsp;1/8". The bottom of the pencil holder 
	was used to sketch a semi-circle on one end. This was cut with the scroll saw. A 
	little sanding and this part was completed. No finish will be applied. It was glued 
	into place. The same 3/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/4" scrap from above was used for the second 
	stop. It was cut to length and the ends were sanded. It was laid against the side of 
	the box, marked, and glued in place. The photo below shows the two clamped parts.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC two stops.jpg" alt="Two stops to hold the microscope and the light box" width="1711" height="2274">

<p>
	Below is a photo of the case at this point after adding hinges.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC case.jpg" alt="Case holding the light box and the scope" width="1880" height="2015">

<p>
	I struggled to find a chain to hold a pin, but seven months later found a cable used 
	for keeping cabinet doors from opening too far. The cable has eyelets on either end. 
	A screw will affix one end to the box. A special pin needs to be made to fit the other 
	end, essentially a pin with a screw hole in one end.
</p>

<p>
	The pin was made without a plan. A 1&nbsp;1/2" length of 3/8" brass hex was found in 
	the scrap box. A 1/4" of one end was reduced to 0.137" and threaded with a 6-32 die. 
	The screw was parted off 1/2" from the end. The ends were lightly chamfered. The 
	remaining length was center drilled and supported with a tailstock center. It was 
	reduced to 0.140" in diameter for 3/4". The part was flipped and held by the reduced 
	section. The opposite end was center drilled, drilled with a #29 drill and tapped 
	6-32. The screw had to be shortened a bit before the gap between it and the nut was 
	about right for the eyelet. The photo below shows the parts at this stage.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microCase/MC catch parts.jpg" alt="The parts for the case's catch" width="1831" height="1118">

<p>
	The case was marked and punched for drilling. The door was held shut with a clamp. 
	The case and door were drilled with a 1/8" drill followed by a #26 drill and 
	eventually by a #27 drill for and easy fit. The side of the case was drilled and a 
	small brass screw was installed with a washer and one end of the cable. The photo 
	below shows the parts in place on the case. The screw and the nut were sanded to 
	2000 grit for a nice finish. They were also painted with varnish.
