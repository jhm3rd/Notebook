<p class=first>
	I was in the mood for a simple project, while figuring out how to use the new laser 
	cutter and engraver. This project to make rotary table extensions was buried in my 
	database of possible projects. The source is 
	<a href="https://eversole.us/blog/?p=252">eversole</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The extenders are just aluminum bars with holes appropriately drilled. The tapped 
	holes in each bar provide for the use of strap clamps or other work holding 
	devices. These bars were made from scrap 1/4" thick aluminum bar stock that was less 
	than 1" wide. The bar was cut into two pieces approximately 2&nbsp;1/2" long. While
	holding the two bars in the mill all four edges were squared up. The two bars at this 
	stage are seen below.

	The bars were painted with Dykem and marked out. The centerline was marked at 27/64" 
	with the new height gauge. The four holes were marked from one end in 1/2" intervals. 
	The bars marked for drilling are shown below.

	A bar was set on parallels in the milling table vise and the end and center were 
	located. This drilling operation turned out to be my first use of the newly installed 
	DRO. The table was moved to 1/2" and the first hole was center drilled. Further 
	movement along the x-axis and the other three holes were started. The center drill 
	was swapped for a #21 drill and the three holes at 1/2", 1&nbsp;1/2", and 2" were 
	drilled. Moving to the hole at 1", a 7/32" drill was used to drill a through hole 
	for a #10 screw. This hole was countersunk to about 0.95" to fit the screws on hand.
	Finally, a few threads were started with the 10-32 tap in the mill's drill chuck in 
	the other three holes. The second bar was drilled the same.
</p>

<p>
	The DRO made this so much simpler and quicker as so many fewer changes of tooling 
	were required, as I was now confident of my ability to accurately return the spindle 
	to a previous location.
</p>

<p>
	Tapping was finished holding the bars in the vise. The holes were all deburred as 
	needed. The final step in this project was prepping the short screws. Two screws were 
	cut off so that they didn't bottom out when used in the T-slots of the rotary table. 
	The extension bars and their screws are seen in the first photo below. The last photo 
	shows how the extension bars might be used to hold a part on the rotary table.
