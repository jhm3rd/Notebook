# Notebook
A notebook describing my metalworking and woodworking projects
This notebook covers projects starting around 2010.
A webpage covers every project, except for larger projects that are covered with multiple webpages.
The original set of webpages were hosted locally. Only recently did I become aware of the ability to host webpages through GitHub.
The webpages need some modifications to be served on GitHub. For instance the images need to be better organized.
Currently there are close to 200 webpages. The pages will be added as I have the time. I would rather focus on new projects. ;)
The learning curve for GitHub is steep for an elderly man, who knows only enough HTML to compose a simple webpage.
Wish me luck!
