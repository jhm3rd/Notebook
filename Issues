The first issue faced is getting a picture to load in the background.
  The Notebook.css file lists a background image: url"TC10.jpg".
  Putting the image at the same level as the .css file using the name does not show an image when the website is loaded.
  A number of paths were tried: file:///TC10.jpg, etc., but none have worked so far.
The second issue is pictures for each of the project webpages. I would like to put the images in a folder named to coincide with the page name.
  I have not figured out how to add a folder. There are thousands of pictures so I need some way to organize them by project.
