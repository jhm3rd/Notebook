<p class=first>
	The tangential tool holder project was based on an article in Home Shop Machinist; 
	Jan/Feb 2009 (Vol. 28, #1) pg 12. My original write-up was quite sparse. First the
	dimensions of the tool holder were completed. A hole was drilled for the clamp. The 
	center drill was used as an edge finder and then the table was moved into the 
	workpiece the required distance plus half of the center drill diameter. The hole was 
	drilled 0.660" deep with a #21 drill bit and threaded 10-32 for 0.50".
</p>
<p class=note>
	Significant difficulty with too little head room for both drilling procedures. Angle 
	plate + vise raises work piece a minimum of 2 3/4" off the base, even with the vise 
	hanging off the end of the angle plate.
</p>
<p>
	A relief groove was cut with a 3/8" end mill from (0.629 - 0.25) to (0.629 + 0.25) 
	and 0.379 to 0.879 to a depth of 0.050" in 0.010" passes. The cutter was touched 
	against the edge and dialed in 0.379 + 0.375 = 0.754".
</p>
<p>
	The tool holder clamp was begun next. Began with material different in size from the 
	article: 1" instead of 5/8" wide. So the instructions were adjusted accordingly. 
	Angled lines were drawn on the steel bar using the tool holder as a guide. A hacksaw 
	was used to cut the first line. The workpiece was placed on the reference edge in 
	vise, which was still on the 12&deg; angle plate. Too much chatter was experienced 
	with an end mill so the end was finished with a fly cutter. All sides were cleaned 
	up and trimmed to the size of the holder.
</p>
<p>
	The tool holder clamp was clamped above a piece of aluminum waste for drilling. 
	Measuring in from the top 0.38" and across from the side 0.31" located the spindle for 
	drilling. Drilled through with a 13/64" drill bit and counterbored 0.57" deep with 
	a 3/8" end mill. Experienced a lot of chatter even with a lot of cutting fluid. A 
	reasonable fit resulted. The clamp was flipped over to finish the inside cuts. At 
	this point it was noticed that the bar was 1/4" not 3/16" as ordered. The fly 
	cutter was used to narrow to 3/16" and then cut most of the piece up to a scribed 
	line at 0.140". The end was furthered trimmed to 0.130" on the end.
</p>
<p>
	The clamp was attached to the body of the cutter holder with a cutter blank in 
	place. The resulting gap was measured with a thickness gauge at 0.045". The position 
	of the bit was marked with a marker and a groove was cut to the line with a 1/4" 
	end mill to a depth of 0.049". The part was touched up with a file and assembled for 
	a nice tight grip on the bit blank.
</p>
<p>
	The grinding jig was made next. The jig is designed to hold the bit blank 12&deg; 
	from level at an angle of 30&deg;. A 1" X 1/2" X 2 7/8" aluminum block was cleaned up 
	with a file. The angle table was angled at 30&deg; aligned with the mill's y-axis and 
	set to 12&deg;. The center was marked and then a line was drawn with a marker 1/8" 
	to the left of center. Repeated with a line to the right of center. Both lines were 
	60&deg; relative to the edge. The area between the lines was milled out to a depth 
	of 0.315" at the deep end of the groove.
</p>
<p>
	Since the work is 0.265" longer than planned, the hole should be placed 0.875" + 
	0.265/2" = 1.008" from the left end. The workpiece was squared relative to the mill 
	table, but still on the 12&deg; angle plate. Center drilled, drilled with a #21 
	drill bit, and tapped with a 10-32 tap to the bottom of the 0.40" hole. This 
	completed the guide block.
</p>
<p>
	A clamp was then made for the grinding jig. Squared up one end of a brass bar to 
	0.25" X 0.50" X 1.49". Two holes need to be drilled and must be centered and 0.622" 
	apart. This results in each hole being 0.434" in from the side. The brass bar was 
	squared in the vise and drilled with a #9 drill bit (0.196") at 0.434" from the end 
	and 0.25" in from back. The hole was counterbored with a 3/8" end mill. The clamp 
	was advanced 0.622" and the process was repeated. It was a perfect fit with the 
	blank in place! The clamp was polished with a file and plastic sheets(?).
</p>
<p class=note>
	The counterbore was 0.20" deep.
</p>
<p>
	A blank tool bit was ground with the left wheel of the grinder after setting the 
	rest to horizontal. Clearances looked fine after setting the bit to the appropriate 
	height. A problem is that the tool blank is too long. The steel is too hard to cut 
	with a hack saw. Will need to find a source of shorter bits. About 1 3/4" is the 
	maximum length that will work, otherwise the bit hits the lathe bed! What a great 
	project that was based on the level of detail in the article.
</p>
<p class=note>
	Communicated with the author via email (jost.mj@opengate.com.br). He used a chop 
	saw to cut off his bits. I found diamond wheel saws for the Dremel and bought them. 
	After clamping the bit in the mill vise it was cut off with a lot of cutting fluid. 
	Excellent! Put the cut off 1/2" in the clamp and shaved off the front end to provide 
	a bit of relief on facing operations. Did not need to trim the side. Used the new bit 
	after sharpening on the grinding wheel and cut some alumininum. Very smooth!
