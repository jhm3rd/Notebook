	After making the frames for Rhea's quilling she decided she wants to hang the framed 
	pictures. I could find no things for hanging pictures. Wire would be too bulky. The 
	only thing I could think of was the notched hangers attached to the frame and hung 
	over a nail. A had a scrap of aluminum from the heart that was 1&nbsp;7/8" long. The 
	plan is to make two hangers that are 1&nbsp;3/4" by 0.225". The latter width is due 
	to the narrow 1/4" first frame. The thin widths were cut with the hacksaw. Both pieces 
	were then squared up. They had to be clamped to the angle block for cutting. The 
	parallels are too thick for 1/8" stock. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	I should make or buy some thinner parallels.
</p>

<p>
	Once squared up 1/8" holes were drilled on each end. The holes were 1/8" in from the 
	end and centered across the narrow width. The holes were lightly countersunk on the 
	back side and heavily on the front side for the screws. The thin plates were then 
	individually thinned to 1/16" in the center 1&nbsp;1/4". The photo below shows the 
	clamping arrangement for thinning the aluminum strips. They were 'leveled' by 
	aligning the two-flute cutter so both cutters just barely made contact.

	The final task was cutting the notches in the hangers. This was done by rotating the 
	head of the mill to a 45&deg; angle. The cutting edge was centered over the two 
	hangers clamped together on a parallel in the vise. The end mill was lowered 0.042". 
	At a slow speed the cut was made through both hangers. There was no chatter, which 
	was a worry with the poor support. The cutter was moved 0.083" and a second cut was 
	made. Six cuts were made on the right side. The cutter was then moved back to center, 
	0.498" and six cuts were made on the other side. The burrs were removed and the outer 
	face quickly sanded. The hangers were centered on the tops of the frames and screwed 
	into place with #4-1/2" wood screws. The picture below shows one of the hangers 
	installed.
