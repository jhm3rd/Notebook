<p class=first>
	Over the past weekend I attended a <a href="https://www.marcadams.com">MASW</a> 
	course on Making a Stickley style floor lamp led by Kevin Boyle. All of the parts were 
	cut, some glued and some sanding was done. There is a significant amount of work 
	remaining and that is described in the following page. The five photos below show 
	the various parts at this stage: lamp shade, post, corbels, lamp shade supports, and 
	base with feet and post cap.
</p>

<p>
	A quick task was cutting about 1/4" off of the dovetails on the tenons. This was 
	quickly accomplished with a hand saw and a chisel. Care was taken to only remove the 
	bottom 1/4" not the top. The sides of the dovetails on the shade supports were 
	sanded with 80 grit paper wrapped around a scrap of 1/16" thick brass until they fit 
	in the matching dovetail slots in the post.
</p>

<p>
	Before assembly all of the parts need to be sanded to 220 grit. The sides of the 
	corbels and sides of the lampshade supports have already been sanded to 150. The post 
	was not sanded beyond the planer sanding. The corners of the corbels and the lamp 
	shade supports will be lightly rounded. The base was the first part to be sanded. 
	Some burning took place when cutting the base chamfers and this needs to be removed. 
	This was accomplished by sanding with 80 grit as by hand to remove burn marks, then 
	120 and 220 grit on the base using an oscillating sander. The shade supports and 
	corbels were sanded with either 80 grit or the belt sander to remove the bandsaw 
	marks, then sanded to 220 grit on all exposed sides. The corners were rounded with 
	220 grit paper.three and one half hours of sanding completed all pieces. The 
	downdraft table easily contained all of the dust.
</p>

<p>
	The base was drilled. A 1/2" hole was drilled on center using the drill press in the 
	garage as it has a sufficiently deep throat. The holes for the screws into the corbels 
	were drilled 1&nbsp;7/8" from center using a 5/32" drill. These holes were countersunk 
	on the bottom of the base.
</p>

<p>
	The long corners of the post were lightly rounded with 220 grit sandpaper. The 
	corbels were glued on one at a time and held in place with wooden screw clamps as 
	seen in the photo below. After gluing all of the corbels in place the feet were 
	glued to the bottom of the base leaving 1/4" exposed from the top as seen in the 
	second photo. After clamp removal the post was posed on the base in the third photo.
</p>

<p>
	Glue was put in the post's dovetail slots and spread with a small stick of wood. The 
	lamp shade supports were pushed down into the slots and in some cases knocked in place 
	with a mallet. The lamp shade was sanded to 220 grit after removing the tape. A posed 
	photo of the lamp at this stage is seen below. The post has not yet been screwed to 
	the base.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fllmp/SSL lamp mockup.heic" alt="The lamp parts all in place, but the post is not screwed to the base." width="2104" height="3647">

<p>
	Screws, #8-2", were located for attaching the post/corbels to the base. The screw 
	holes in the base are 1&nbsp;7/8" from center. This distance was carefully measured 
	and marked on one corbel. After charging the cordless drill a 1/8" hole was drilled 
	with a depth stop set to 1". A screw was installed and the opposite hole in the base 
	was marked. This hole was drilled after removing the first screw. The two screws 
	were installed and the final two holes were marked. After drilling the base was 
	attached as shown in the photo below. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="fllmp/SSL base attached.heic" alt="The post is screwed to the base." width="2619" height="2375">

<p>
	The lamp is ready for finish application. To that end samples of a desired finish 
	were requested. The article uses two colorants to color the wood, Lockwood Early 
	American Maple golden amber dye followed by Varathane Gunstock stain. The first is 
	a dye that must be dissolved in water. The company only sells their dyes by the 
	pound, but they do sell 1 oz. samples, when five or more are ordered. After 
	selecting four other dyes an email was sent to the company in NYC with the five 
	dyes requested. Lockwood should give me a call at some point to complete the 
	transaction. The Varathane stain is available at Home Depot. In the meantime it is 
	back to Sandy's magnolia.
</p>

<p>
	Now that the magnolia is complete <em>sans</em> installing in the frame, it is time 
	to complete the lamp. The next task is cutting the mica to fit. Pulling the mica 
	from the box revealed two things. First, it is already cut to shape and only needs 
	the long edge of the trapezoid to be cut back about 1/2". Second, the surface finish 
	is poor, very dull.
</p>

<p>
	A jig is needed to cut the long side of the mica, which needs to be trapped between 
	two pieces of wood to minimize chipping. A length of hardboard, a long scrap of 1/4" 
	pine, and a small scrap of 3/4" pine will be screwed together trapping the mica 
	between the hardboard and the long pine scrap. The other end will be held together 
	by hand during the cut. The first order of business is charging the cordless drill!
</p>

<p>
	The jig was put together. (The used jig is seen below.) It was simple to keep the 
	mica sheet trapped in the jig and make the cut. About 1/2" was cut off of each 
	sheet. The four sheets sitting in the upside down shade are also pictured below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fllmp/SSL mica sheets.heic" alt="The mica sheets laying in the shade frame." width="2988" height="2667">

<p>
	In corners where the top layer of the mica has been peeled off the finish is quite 
	shiny and pretty. I am not sure how to replicate this, but will use the cutoffs for 
	some experiments. Sanding with 400 to 600 to 1000 grit sand paper does leave a 
	shinier finish. It gets rid of the orange peel look. Peeling off a razor-thin layer 
	of mica does the best job, but this only works for small patches.
</p>

<p>
	A bit of research was helpful. The mica is probably supplied by Asheville Mica, though 
	you can only purchase 0.015" and 0.030" thick sheets directly from their website. The 
	mica sheet is made from shellac and mica flakes. Sanding mostly removes the shellac. 
	Buffing with a cloth wheel on the Dremel made little difference, though quickly got 
	hot, which might melt the shellac. The only other idea I have for creating a shinier 
	finish on the mica is a coat of shellac. That experiment will await the purchase of 
	shellac.
</p>

<p>
	The lamp needs to be completed this week, assuming the purchased dye arrives. The 
	cap was completed this morning. The center was marked in the 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2&nbsp;1/4" 
	square of oak. The electrical box for the lights was measured at 2&nbsp;1/8" diameter. 
	This allows two screws to be put in the corners of the cap and accessed after 
	attaching the light mounting box. Two holes were marked in opposite corners at 
	1&nbsp;1/4" distances from center.
</p>

<p>
	The center hole was drilled through with a 1/2" Forstner bit with the cap clamped 
	to the table. Without moving the cap, a 3/4" counterbore was drilled 3/16" deep in 
	the back. The two mounting holes were drilled to fit the #6 screws chosen for 
	mounting. These holes were also counterbored for the screw heads. A chamfer was 
	planed on all four top edges of the cap as shown in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fllmp/SSL top cap.heic" alt="The drilled and chamfered top cap." width="1753" height="1459">

<p>
	The dye, Early American Maple Medium Yellow, arrived today from Lockwood. One oz. is 
	to be dissolved in 2-4 pints of water. I am leaning toward more dilute, but will run 
	an experiment before diluting all of it to the max. To this end the one oz. package 
	was dissolved in two pints of hot water with shaking using a 1/2 gal. plastic milk 
	bottle. The water needs to cool before use.
</p>

<p class="note">
	In the future use this <a href="https://toolsforworkingwood.com/store/dept/CLWW">site</a> 
	for purchasing Lockwood dyes.
</p>

<p>
	A story stick was made up for stains, combinations and poly, but not much was 
	learned from it. The three parts of the lamp were dyed with the yellow dye this 
	morning. A bit of the dye was poured into a small plastic dish and the solution was 
	painted on with a brush, followed by an easy water cleanup. The parts are shown 
	below in two photos. The shade had mostly dried and is a paler shade than the 
	wet stand.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fllmp/SSL stand yellow.heic" alt="The wet lamp stand dyed with the Lockwood yellow." width="3482" height="3426">

<p>
	The first stain raised the grain in places so the entire lamp was sanded very lightly 
	with 220 grit sandpaper and the dust blown off. After five hours of drying time the 
	second stain, Varathane Gunstock, oil based, was painted on and wiped off. It was 
	left to dry for 24 hours before applying the water based polyurethane. Multiple coats 
	of poly were started the next afternoon. Three coats seemed to be sufficient and no 
	sanding was done between coats, but the finish is quite smooth.
</p>

<p>
	Assembly is the final step. First the mica panels need to be glued to the shade 
	frame with silicone caulk. My six year old unopened tube was cut leaving a very tiny 
	hole. A long steel rod was sharpened and used to punch a few holes in the inner 
	membrane. No caulk could be coaxed from the tube, so it is back to Menards. A brief 
	outing later the end of the tube was cut off leaving as small a hole as possible. 
	The caulk was squirted onto the inside of the frame members in a very thin line. 
	The mica panels were pressed in place and then clamped as seen below. I am guessing 
	24 hours for the caulk to harden.
</p>

<p>
	The final task is wiring the lamp. The cord was pushed through the base and then the 
	post. The lamp assembly comes wired making it impossible to put the top nut and 
	lock washer on the supporting tube. This tube did screw into the base of the fixture,
	so hopefully that is sufficient holding power. The top cap was put in place and 
	with the aid of a nut and lock washer affixed to the bottom of the light fixture. The 
	wire with plug was first attached to the wire coming from the lamp fixture with two 
	wire nuts. These did not fit into the post's hole, so were replaced with electrician's 
	tape. Two holes were drilled into the top of the post to secure the top cap, which was 
	screwed in place. The lamp was plugged in and worked as seen below. <em>(Yes, both sides 
	were tested! But there is only one bulb.)</em>
</p>

<p>
	When the clamps were removed from the mica panels, the lamp was moved to the living 
	room and plugged in. The final picture is shown below.
