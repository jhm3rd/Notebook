	The handles on the cross slide on the South Bend lathe are held on with a new to me 
	type of screw. The head is similar to a slotted head, but the slot is interrupted. 
	This type of screw requires a pin wrench, which could be purchased but seemed  
	straightforward to make. The nut is 1/2" diameter. The pin holes are 1/16" X 1/8" 
	and separated by 1/4".

	The first attempt at making this pin wrench used a length of 1/2" hex bar stock. 
	A 1 1/4" piece was cut off with a hacksaw. Both ends were faced in the lathe. One 
	end was reduced to 0.497" for 1/4". This was placed in a vise in the mill and this 
	same end was cut crosswise with a 1/4" cutter to a depth of 0.080" in eight passes. 
	This cut was repeated on the other side after rotating the workpiece 180&deg;. The 
	same end mill was then used to cut a slot in this thinned section to a depth of 
	1/8". The part was then cross drilled in the vise with a 1/8" drill bit for a 
	tommy bar. After cleaning with a file attempted to use the wrench to remove a nut 
	holding the cross slide handle. Unfortunately, both pins simply twisted in the 
	process! Clearly the pin wrench needs to be hardened prior to use. A second pin 
	wrench was now called for.

<p>This wrench was to be made a little differently. Dimensions were captured from the a 
	photo of a wrench for sale on eBay. The hex end was made first. A 1 1/2" length of 
	1/2" steel round bar stock was faced on both ends in the lathe. One end was reduced 
	to 5/16" for 1". The "Calc Hex Dimensions" tool was used  for determining depth of 
	cut. The 4-jaw chuck was attached to the rotary table set up vertically on the bed 
	of the mill. The part was placed in the 4-jaw chuck. Run out was reduced to less 
	than 0.001". The edge was located and 0.019" was removed with a 5/16" end mill for 
	a length of 0.5". The table was rotated 60&deg; and the cut was repeated. After all 
	sides were finished bit fit was checked in a hex bit holder. A bit of filing was 
	required as the fit was quite tight.
</p>
<p>
	The part was moved to the vise and 0.222" was removed with a 5/16" end mill in 0.005" 
	passes to a depth of 0.312". The part was rotated 180&deg; and repeated the cut on 
	the opposite side. The width at the thinnest part measured 0.065" so removed 0.005" 
	from each side. 
</p>
<p class=note>Probably getting flex as part is thinned.</p>
<p>
	Set in the vise with the blade parallel to the table. Located the center and used a 
	1/4" bit to cut a slot across the thin part to a depth of 1/8". Then switch to a 
	3/16" bit to wide the slot to 0.188". Then removed 0.016" from each side to get to 
	the final slot dimension. The pin wrench worked without hardening.
