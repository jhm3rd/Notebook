<p class=first>
	Two parts of the South Bend have needed repairs since before the rebuild. There is a 
	tremendous amount of backlash in the cross slide feed screw, 0.07". There is also a 
	set of parts missing from the back gear to keep it locked in position when in use. 
</p>

<p>
	The cross slide feed screw was tackled first. The feed screw was removed by first 
	removing the slotted nut holding the handle in place. A pin wrench was used to 
	loosen the screw's locking nut. The screw could then be screwed all the way out of 
	the cross slide nut. The screw's dial had a gap adjacent to the screw's locking nut. 
	The gap was measured at 0.023" with feeler gauges. A brass shim washer was made to 
	take up this gap. A length of brass hex was faced and reduced to 0.67". It was 
	center drilled and drilled up to 3/8" to a depth of 3/16". The parting tool was used 
	to part off a 0.023" washer. The edges were deburred. The lead screw was taken apart 
	and the washer was inserted per the South Bend Lathe Rebuild manual. The lead screw 
	was put back together and screwed into the cross slide nut. As expected the backlash 
	was reduced to 0.05". A new cross slide nut was ordered from Ebay. Luckily the 
	company offers both the normal nut and the modified version for lathes equipped with 
	the taper attachment.
</p>

<p>
	The manual mentioned above was quite confusing with respect to the back gear. It only 
	mentions the one adjusting slotted set screw and locking nut for the 9" lathe. For the 
	10" it shows both the same screw and locking nut on the distal end as well as a square 
	headed set screw, spring and shoe on the opposite side of the headstock. The former 
	is to adjust the spacing between the gears. The latter is to hold the back gear in 
	place when it is in use. The latter is missing on my lathe.
</p>

<p>
	I decided to make a set similar to the parts shown for the 10" lathe. The set screw 
	associated with spring and shoe is the same size and pitch as the set screw I have 
	as shown by screwing it into the opposite hole. The manual indicates a length of 
	1/2" of threads. (The picture shown is not of a square head set screw!) The screw for 
	the left side is 5/16-24. The shoe shown in the picture is about 1/4" long as is the 
	spring. The spring and shoe should be 0.25" in diameter for a comfortable fit in the 
	threaded hole. The music wire, 0.020", for the spring was ordered today.
</p>

<p>
	The square headed set screw needs to be made. According to the American National 
	Standard on Square Bolts a 5/16" head needs the following dimensions. It is 0.50" 
	across the flats and 13/64" high. The 0.5" seems like it would be too big as this 
	is not a bolt, but a set screw. I will make it the same size as the screw in the 
	lantern tool post, <3/8". Then the same wrench can be used to adjust it. If it is 
	made from 1/2" round stock it will have nicely rounded corners. (0.53" is the 
	diagonal length for a 0.375" square.) I found a stash of key stock that ranges in 
	size from 1/8" to 1/2". It was from Klaus Schmiegel. I don't know how it will 
	machine, but it is certainly worth trying.
</p>

<p>
	I am not sure exactly what the key stock is made of. It is zinc plated. I cut off a 
	1&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2" length of the 3/8" key stock. It was held in the four jaw chuck 
	and zeroed in. It was reduced to 0.312" for slightly over 3/4". The surface finish is 
	marginal. The end was chamfered. An attempt was made to start the 5/16-24 die in the 
	lathe, but it not was possible. The die was put in a holder and the part was held in 
	the vise. The die was successfully started. The thread was cut with some difficulty 
	even though a lot of cutting fluid was used. The thread did not fit in the hole in 
	the back gear bracket. The die was tightened and the part rethreaded. Very little 
	material was removed, but the screw fit nicely. About 1/4" of the square end was 
	cut off with a hacksaw. The four edges were rounded somewhat with the lathe tool. 
	The end corners were filed and the flats sanded. The final screw is shown below.
</p>

<p>
	Making the spring is next on the agenda. To make the spring two jigs are needed. The 
	first is a spring wire tensioner. This is a simple device to keep just a bit of drag 
	on the wire as it is wound. A 3/4" bar of 1/4" hot rolled steel was found in the 
	scrap bin. It is a little short of 3" long. The width varied across the length. The 
	rough side was made parallel to the opposite side with the two flute end mill. The 
	bar was drilled on one end through for a 5/16" bolt about 0.5" in from the end. 
	Similarly the other end was drilled for a 1/4" shaft, 1/4" from the end. Both holes 
	were centered across the width. The end of the part with the 1/4" hole was drilled 
	and tapped 6-32. A small set screw was installed. The wire will run through shafts 
	sitting in the two holes.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatRep/SBL tensioner drilled.jpg" alt="The base of the tensioner" width="1551" height="1507">

<p>
	Three more parts were made for the tensioner. A small shaft of brass was reduced to 
	1/4" for 3/8" and to 5/16" for 3/8" on the opposite end. A small bearing surface was 
	left between the two reduced ends. About 1/16" above this bearing surface on the 
	wider end a small hole was drilled through with a #53 drill. A 5/16" screw was cut 
	off at 11/16" from the head with a hacksaw. A flat was milled on the threads against 
	the head. A hole was drilled through the screw centered on this flat 3/32" from the 
	head again with the #53 drill. A brass washer was quickly made that is 3/32" thick. 
	This group of parts is shown in the first photo below. The assembled tensioner is 
	shown in the second.
</p>

<p>
	The mandrel for the spring needs to account for the approximately 33% increase in 
	spring diameter after removing the spring. The desired OD is 0.25". OD - 2X wire 
	diameter times 67% means the mandrel should be about 1/8" OD. A 1&nbsp;1/2" length 
	of 3/8" drill rod was faced on one end and center drilled. With the half-center in 
	place 3/4" of the rod was reduced to 0.125". The rod was held in the finger plate. 
	It was drilled through the 1/8" segment close to the 3/8" part with a #53 drill. The 
	photo below shows the completed mandrel.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatRep/SBL mandrel.jpg" alt="The spring making mandrel" width="1173" height="1008">

<p>
	Ready to make the first spring! The tensioner was clamped to the Sherline tool 
	holder with a C-clamp. It was held so the bottom of the tensioner was 9/16" above 
	the bottom of the tool holder. This put the wire roughly on center. The lathe was 
	set up for threading 30 TPI. The mandrel was put in the three jaw chuck and the 
	tensioner was roughly aligned with the hole in the mandrel. A 0.032" wire was 
	slipped through the two holes of the tensioner and through the hole in the mandrel. 
	The tensioner was tightened finger tight. The crank was turned opposite to threading 
	so the spring would be wound away from the headstock. The first spring was a mess. 
	I tried again with the tensioner much closer to the mandrel. This worked perfectly 
	and produced a nice spring, though the coils were very close together. The spring 
	was removed from the mandrel with a cutting disk mounted in the Dremel. The gears 
	were changed to produce 20 TPI and a third spring was made. This spring was also 
	also cut off of the mandrel with the Dremel. The photos below document this process. 
	The last photo shows the second and third springs. The third spring is more open 
	than the second.

<p>
	The article suggested 20-40% allowance for mandrel size as the springs loosen a bit 
	when the tension is released. Thus the 33% allowance noted above. Both good springs 
	were 0.205" OD. Theoretical OD is 0.125" plus twice the diameter of the wire or 
	0.165". This is closer to a 25% allowance, so the mandrel ideally needs to be about 
	0.175" in diameter. The ends of the spring were cut off at a taper with the Dremel.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Turning the handle counterclockwise as described above does pose one problem. The 
	chuck can come unscrewed. Making the third screw was most easily accomplished by 
	turning the chuck instead of the handle.
</p>

<p>
	The backgear was completed this afternoon. The set screw with jam nut was installed. 
	The set screw was tightened sufficiently so that there is just a little gear rattle. 
	The jam nut then locked the set screw in place. A shoe was made from a rod of 1/4" 
	brass. The end of the rod was filed with a half round file to put a slight curve on 
	it. The end of the rod was parted off at 3/8". This shoe was pushed up into the hole, 
	followed by the spring, and the square headed screw. The square headed screw was 
	tightened by hand until it felt sufficiently tight to keep the back gear from popping 
	out. The back gear lock was pulled out. The back gear lever was moved to join the 
	back gears. The lathe was turned on. All worked perfectly. There was only a slight 
	gear rattle, so the lever is adjusted properly. The first picture below shows the 
	completed components for the back gear tension adjustment. The second picture tries 
	to show the location of this tension adjustment on the lathe headstock.
