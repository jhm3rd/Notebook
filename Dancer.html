<p class=first>
	The plan is to make a marquetry present for Rhea's upcoming birthday in three months. 
	If I start now, it might be ready in time. A picture of a dancer was selected from 
	pics on the web and is shown below. The picture looks simple enough that I should 
	be able to manage the marquetry. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR dancer.jpg" alt="A picture of a dancer" width="557" height="1024">

<p>
	First, the marquetry plan needs to be laid out. The first step in this process is 
	defining the packets. A packet is a natural unit that usually incorporates some 
	level of complexity warranting a separate construction prior to installing in the 
	background veneer. This image has eight potential packets. The head, neck, shirt, 
	and skirt should be treated as packets. The arms and legs will also be treated as 
	packets due to the bracelets on each. Another approach for these last four would be 
	treating the sets of bracelets as entities and just cutting them into the corresponding 
	arm or leg after installing the arm or leg in the background. 
</p>

<p>
	The next step is determining the number of colors and the veneer that will portray 
	each color. There are at least eight colors minimum, maybe as many as twelve, plus 
	the background. Of course most of the colors will be changed to wood tones. The skin 
	in many places has darker shadows. Some actually represent shadows and some represent 
	bodily features, e.g. eyes, nose, and mouth. This darkening could be accomplished by 
	burning the wood. My class taught how to burn an edge or a piece of veneer to serve 
	as a shadow, but most of the darker places here are internal or along the inside of 
	bends. These could not be made by briefly dipping the veneer in hot sand. Wood 
	burning might be the way to proceed. It just so happens a wood burning or soldering 
	kit was purchased a few years ago and used only once.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR woodburning.JPG" alt="The wood burning kit" width="2223" height="1906">

<p>
	Today I ordered $100 worth of veneer. I went to 
	<a href="https://www.veneersupplies.com">Veneer Supplies</a> and ordered their 
	"Incredible Box of Veneer". It is over 100 square feet of veneer from over 40 types 
	of wood. I think this should last me a lifetime. It will certainly have the variety 
	needed for this project. The box arrived a few days later and is as spectacular as 
	I hoped. Lots of different species of trees are included. Time to make some tough 
	decisions. I realized one of the two dyed colors needed is blue, which I don't have. 
	I will purchase some dye from Veneer Supplies. It is not up to Marc Adams standards, 
	but may be sufficient for my needs. Shown below are the veneers chosen so far, for 
	skin color and its shadow, the background, and three orange colors.
</p>

<p>
	It is time to map out the order of events to produce this "painting in wood". The 
	following set of marquetry steps is from the marquetry class notes.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Acquire an image from any source</li>
	<li>Trace the entire image</li>
	<li>Make a black & white copy of the tracing paper</li>
	<li>Consider sunlight, shading, and grain direction</li>
	<li>Define the packets for all multi-piece entities</li>
	<li>Trace each entity in its entirety</li>
	<li>Select the background and the colors for the entities</li>
	<li>Transfer the entity onto wood aligned with the grain</li>
	<li>Tape on the second piece of veneer with the grain properly aligned</li>
	<li>Cut the parts of the entity apart (keeper to the left of the blade!)</li>
	<li>Keep the top of left (or keeper piece) and the bottom of the other part; flip
	and align; tape and rub with a roller to remove wrinkles and bubbles</li>
	<li>Repeat for the rest of the packets.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	The dancer was traced as seen in the photo below. Looking at the picture and 
	considering the challenges of cutting entailed, I might do a larger image. The 
	dancer was opened in Preview and its size doubled. The majority of the new view 
	was saved via a copied selection as Dancer top with the remainder saved as Dancer 
	bottom. These will be printed separately, but traced as a whole.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR first tracing.jpg" alt="A tracing of the printed black and white picture" width="1708" height="2188">

<p>
	This was done producing a much larger image. In order to fit it on a page of 
	tracing paper it had to be rotated slightly (12&deg;). This rotation will need to be 
	undone when putting the image in the background. The photo below shows the enlarged 
	tracing. The picture when oriented vertically is about 13" long, placing a lower 
	limit on the size of the background.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR second tracing.jpg" alt="A tracing of the two printed enlarged images" width="1408" height="1781">

<p>
	So much for getting an early start. It is now the middle of April! This morning a 
	copy of the traced image was made. The let foot is cut off, but that can be easily 
	fixed when transferring the image for the left leg packet. I am first going to 
	assign veneer to each of the parts and then experiment with wood burning. Burning 
	will be substantially easier for the shadows on the legs and arms and a necessity for 
	the facial features. The table below shows the veneer assignments at this point.

<p>
	The streamers are the only parts of this picture that are not part of packets. They 
	will be made from the lightest orange veneer, the spotted brown veneer and the plain 
	brown veneer. Dyes are being considered for light blue and green. There are two 
	violet pieces in the picture. I've not decided how to represent these.
</p>

<p class="note">
	I am reconsidering dyeing wood blue for the jewelry. The shell, Abalam, may be ideal 
	for these parts, if I can cut them. The dye is mixed with water, alcohol or a mix of 
	alcohol and lacquer thinner. It is mixed 2 oz. per half gallon. This translates to 
	0.75 teaspoons to 2 oz of diluent. Alcohol or alcohol mix is recommended to minimize 
	grain raising. The mixture is recommended to maximize penetration, but it is still a 
	surface dye.
</p>

<p>
	The wood burning was amazingly straightforward. The iron was set to a temperature of 
	425&deg; C. After warming it darkened the wood with a touch. The only challenge is 
	orienting the tip of the tool to cover the wood appropriately. The photo below shows 
	three burned edges of a scrap of veneer.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR burn exp.jpg" alt="Scrap veneer burned on three edges." width="1956" height="1827">

<p>
	A few days later and I had acquired the paraphernalia to test some dyes. One ounce of 
	denatured ethanol and one ounce of lacquer thinner were combined in a jar. 3/4 of a 
	teaspoon of dye was added to the solvent mix. This process was followed for the 
	yellow dye and the blue dye. The third sample was a mixture of the dyes, ~3/8 of a 
	teaspoon of both yellow and blue. A strip of the background veneer was dipped in 
	each of the three jars of dye. After one to two minutes the strips were removed. The 
	second photo below shows the results. The yellow is a little faint, the blue is 
	outstanding, and the green is also a little faint. But all should work for my needs.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR dye exp.jpg" alt="Scrap veneer dyed in three colors." width="1510" height="1288">

<p>
	Half of the dark blue stain was diluted in one ounce of 1:1 ethanol:thinner for light 
	blue. Four pieces of veneer were cut from the background sheet. The smallest piece was 
	dyed green. One was dyed yellow, one light blue and one dark blue. The diluted dye 
	was applied with a brush on both sides, though the dye seemed to rapidly penetrate 
	completely through the veneer. The veneer was pressed between two sheets of paper 
	towel to dry. 
</p>

<p>
	Off to the races this Monday morning after the whirlwind dulcimer class this past 
	weekend. A simple packet was chosen for the first, the right leg. A 5"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" 
	rectangle of the dark brown skin veneer was cut with the knife. The leg was drawn on 
	this veneer by tracing over copy paper. It was very difficult to see the image so it 
	was gone over with the pencil. Should probably switch to white copy paper when 
	using this veneer in the future. A piece of red veneer was cut and blue taped to the 
	brown. The image was drawn on the red veneer. A cut was made through the junction 
	of the two colors. The table was tilted down 7.5&deg; to the left and the red piece 
	was kept to the left of the blade. The parts were untaped, assembled and retaped with 
	white veneer tape. This process was repeated with the blue veneer for the blue 
	bracelet and for the brown veneer for the remainder of the leg. The photo below shows 
	the completed packet.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR right leg.jpg" alt="The first packet, the right leg." width="1191" height="2255">

<p>
	The second packet tackled is the left leg shown in the photo below. The leg is 
	"broken" at the knee so the grain will be correctly oriented. This break is seen 
	in the second photo. So the first cut was between the thigh and the calf. There 
	were three cuts for each bracelet and a final cut for the foot. The completed 
	packet is shown the the third photo.

<p>
	Went looking for the Abalam this morning and discovered the blue veneer purchased 
	from MASW. This was used for the major blue portion of the skirt. The long light 
	blue part of the skirt was made from my blue dyed veneer. Three packets were built 
	this morning: the left arm, the shirt and the skirt. The skirt was complex and took 
	a bit of planning to get it right. The photo below shows the three completed packets.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR 3 packets.jpg" alt="Three completed packets, left arm, shirt and skirt." width="1969" height="1962">

<p>
	The right arm was reasonably straightforward. Like the bent leg this arm was broken 
	into two parts at the elbow. The first photo shows the completed right arm packet. 
	The head (hat) was very complicated and consequently was simplified. The right side 
	of the hat and the left side of the bun share common lines among multiple pieces so 
	some double cutting was necessitated. The second photo shows the finished head 
	packet. The yellow tape was needed as the veneer tape was not holding all of the 
	pieces well.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR rt arm.jpg" alt="The completed right arm packet." width="1925" height="1488">
<img class=inline src="images/DFR head packet.jpg" alt="The completed head packet." width="1649" height="1736">

<p class="note">
	It is time to cut the body into the background. There are two choices at this point. 
	The first is cutting each of the packets in. This means there will be double cutting 
	at the junctures of some of the packets. The alternative is assembling all of the 
	packets into one large packet. This single packet can then be cut into the background. 
	The alternative sounds best, but comes with added hurdle of one long continuous cut 
	around the entire packet. On the other hand the way the skirt tassels will be cut in 
	might serve as an viable approach. The tassels will be longer than pictured and cut 
	into the background before the skirt. That way when the skirt is added the tassels 
	are automatically in place. The key to making this work is that the tassel is 
	narrower than the skirt and can extend into the area of the future skirt. Is this 
	possible with the body parts?
</p>

<p>
	Before starting on cutting the packets into the background the scroll saw needed an 
	upgrade. A 2'&nbsp;X&nbsp;4' length of 3/16" thick hard board was purchased from 
	Menards. The shape of the scroll saw table is approximately a 16" diameter circle 
	extended at the back to a total length of 2'. A circle was drawn on the hard board. 
	Extensions were drawn to the back leaving 3" between their ends and tangent to the 
	circle. With the crosscut sled the large amount of excess board was cut off. The 
	piece with the scroll saw shape marked out was cut at angles on both sides using the 
	bevel gauge to produce the two tangent lines. The circle was cut with the scroll saw. 
	A 1/8" hole was drilled in the center of the circle. The zero clearance table top 
	was taped to the scroll saw table proper with double sided carpet tape. The photo 
	shows the zero clearance table in place with a small blade ready for veneer work.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR zero clearance.jpg" alt="The installed zero clearance auxilliary scroll saw table." width="2228" height="2185">

<p>
	I am convinced the packets can be individually cut in like the tassels will. The legs 
	and the tassels should be cut in first, all extending beyond the skirt's edge. The 
	skirt is behind the shirt as are the left and right arms. The right arm is also 
	behind the head. Consequently, the following order should be followed after 
	transferring the dancer to the background with two crosshairs. The process begins 
	with the left and right legs along with the tassels. Then the skirt is added. The 
	two arms are cut in next followed by the shirt and then the head.
</p>

<p>
	This means the legs and tassels need to be extended somewhat beyond their junctions 
	with the skirt. Similarly, the skirt needs to extend beyond the junction with the 
	shirt, the arms need to be extended beyond the shirt junctions, and the shirt also 
	needs to go beyond the head. 
</p>

<p>
	A backboard for the dancer was made this morning. A piece of 1/4" plywood was cut to 
	9.5"&nbsp;X&nbsp;15.25". The length was set by the angled dancer and the width was 
	set to the golden ratio using the divider from MASW. A batch of walnut veneer had been 
	purchased from MASW. Two pieces of this that were split multiply were pulled from 
	the veneer box. They were overlapped and a line cut through both to provide straight 
	matching edges. They were trimmed to width. To avoid further splitting the ends 
	were taped with yellow tape before cutting to length. Glue was spread evenly over the 
	plywood sheet, the veneer applied, and the whole was placed in the vacuum box. THe 
	vacuum was released after three hours.
</p>

<p>
	I am now back to the dancer after twelve days of working on the Altoids box. The 
	background was cut oversize using the backing as a guide. The image on tracing paper 
	was transferred to the background along with three crosshairs after setting the image 
	to the appropriate angle. (It was not necessary to transfer the image, but I wanted 
	to see it on the background.) The right leg packet was aligned using the tracing 
	paper. It was taped in place with blue tape. A hole was poked through the hidden part 
	of the leg and the background using the dental tool. The photo shows the packet taped 
	to the background.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR rt leg.jpg" alt="The right leg packet taped and ready to be cut into the background." width="1503" height="2363">

<p>
	I realized that the wood burning needed to be done prior to cutting the packet into 
	the background. All parts were burned as needed with the woodburner set to 300&deg;. 
	The blade was threaded through the leg packet on background and the outline was cut. 
	The cutting went okay. The parts were separated and the backside was taped with white 
	veneer tape. The front side is seen in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR rl cutin.jpg" alt="The right leg packet cut into the background." width="1694" height="1934">

<p>
	The eight skirt tassels were cut in next. Each was laid out on the appropriate color 
	of veneer. Two were yellow, three light orange veneer, and three were the light brown 
	veneer chosen above. Each of these were laid in the correct position, taped in place, 
	cut in, and taped with veneer tape. Broken pieces of veneer were repaired along the 
	way by placing a drop of glue on the veneer tape and cutting a fragment to fit or 
	using a matching fragment. The picture at this stage is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR tassels.jpg" alt="The eight tassels cut into the background." width="1382" height="2438">

<p>
	The left leg was cut in this morning. After a walk the skirt was cut in over the two 
	legs and the eight tassels. Both went well. One of the toes needed a repair. In both 
	cases there was a nice 'pop' as the packets were pressed into the background. The 
	two photos below document these two operations.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR skirt in.jpg" alt="The skirt cut into the background." width="1514" height="2296">

<p>
	The left arm was more challenging than the previous packets. Before cutting the 
	packet in the hand was covered with yellow tape. Cutting around the hand went well, 
	but splitting occurred at the shoulder. It was an easy fix, just pop in the piece 
	and tape as usual. There was also a small bit of background that popped loose next 
	to the blue bracelet. This was glued in place. The marquetry was left to dry for an 
	hour. The right arm was then cut in. This was complicated by the fact that both the 
	shirt and head would be cut in over it and it comes close to the left arm.
</p>

<p>
	Coming down the home stretch for the packets. The shirt was cut in. There were a few 
	hiccups, but none that required repairs. The photo shows the outcome.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR shirt in.jpg" alt="The shirt cut into the background." width="1813" height="1806">

<p class="note">
	A mistake came to light this morning. The wood burning has been good for practice, but 
	has been done on the back side of the marquetry!! It will be more challenging to do 
	after the parts are all in place. I will console myself with the realization that I 
	was not happy with some of the wood burning anyway.
</p>

<p>
	The final packet, the head, was cut in with some consternation. Three repairs were 
	necessary to replace two fractures and one piece coming loose. The photo shows the 
	results of this operation.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DFR head in.jpg" alt="The head cut into the background." width="1750" height="1833">

<p>
	I am not yet sure how to best complete the marquetry. I would like to add an earring, 
	a necklace, and decoration to the skirt. Ideally, some of these decorations will be 
	made from mother of pearl, Abalam. My initial thought is cutting them in with a knife. 
	I will experiment with using the scroll saw to cut Abalam. These results might change 
	my plan. I was able to cut pieces to shape with the scroll saw, but not cut them into 
	veneer. A heart shaped piece was cut from the Abalam. A little sanding produced a nice 
	shape. This was held against the blue part of the skirt and a line was carefully drawn 
	around it. Even more carefully the shape was cut out of the skirt keeping the knife 
	inside the line. Veneer tape was put on the back side, glue was put in the opening, 
	and the heart was pressed into place. It is a nice fit.
</p>

<p>
	The belt that holds the above jewel was next. It was traced onto a piece of red dyed 
	veneer. This was positioned with the picture and taped in place. A hole was punched 
	in the corner by the waist. The belt was cut out, popped in place, and taped. A small 
	tearout needed repair, which was done with a drop of glue and the recovered fragment. 
	The photo below shows the belt and the jewel in place.

	The necklace was not quite so successful. It was glued in place in three fragments. 
	An earring was made from a small cutoff of Abalam. It started as a rectangle and was 
	sanded to shape. Like before it was traced onto the veneer and cut with a knive 
	inside the line. After some cleanup cutting it fit tightly and was glued into place 
	as seen in the photo below. (The nicer side of the Abalam is glued down, so it will 
	show in the final product.) We are ready for glue-up!!

	The veneer was cut to fit the backing. Glue was spread on the backing and the 
	marquetry was applied. The whole was put in the vacuum press for two hours as seen 
	in the photo below. Also shown is the taped side after removal from the press.

	After allowing the glue to dry overnight the scraper was honed and a burr produced. 
	The scraper was used to remove most of the veneer tape. Then I switched to the 
	orbital sander with 120 grit paper. After removing all of the tape the paper was 
	switched to 220 grit for a final sanding. This process is shown below.

	I noticed a problem near the lower foot. It looked like brown sawdust had collected 
	in a depression below the toe. I could feel the depression. I thought I should be 
	able to carefully sand below the toe and remove the sawdust. What I was doing was 
	sanding through the veneer! The photo below shows the damage. I am exploring ways to 
	repair this mistake.

	The shadows were drawn on the legs, arms and neck. These were then burned with a 
	round tipped tool in the wood burner. The first photo shows the result. A second 
	finer round tip was used to burn the lines for the eyes, nose and mouth. This is 
	shown in the second photo below.

	A scrap of background veneer was sanded until it was very thin in one small spot. 
	This spot was covered with a second piece of the same veneer and the two glued 
	together. After the glue dried the veneer sandwich was sanded. It looked good, so 
	the same procedure was tried on the dancer. A small scrap of veneer was cut to 
	slightly larger than the spot sanded through. It was glued over the sanded area. 
	After drying the veneer was sanded off. Unfortunately, even before reaching the 
	plane of the background veneer the dark underlying plywood became visible. Did 
	the glue pull the color up?
</p>

<p class="note">
	The yellow and green dyed veneers sanded fine and the color was not sanded off, even 
	though the dye does not penetrate completely through the veneer. My lucky day!
</p>

<p>
	The three pieces from class were finished with brushed on lacquer. That will be 
	used here as well. Before doing that a repair was implemented. The offending spot 
	below the foot was cut out, first by outlining with a knife and then scraping the 
	veneer out with a chisel. A mating piece was carefully cut and glued in place. This 
	was clamped and left for a few hours. The photo shows the patch after a bit of 
	sanding.

	The dancer was painted with lacquer. Two coats were applied separated by two hours. 
	The two photos below show the outcome. It is difficult to ovid glare, so the photos 
	are not completely indicative of the final outcome.

	Some oak molding was found and purchased from Menards. The molding was first stained 
	with the mix of stain used for the G&G table. I wanted it a little darker so went 
	over it a second time with the brown stain. I pulled out the frame cutting jig. After 
	relearning how to use it, it became apparent that the rabbet on the molding was too 
	deep for the top and bottom of the picture. Some 1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/4" strips were 
	cut from a piece of 1/4" poplar. Two 13" lengths of the molding were cut by hand. 
	One had one strip clued into the rabbet and the other had two. The piece with two 
	is for the frame member above the hand. The photo shows the clamped parts.
</p>

<p class="note">
	As a reminder this jig works directly off of the size of the picture. After making 
	the first miter cut, the second miter cut is made 1/8" longer than the length of that 
	side of the picture. The jig measures on the inside of the rabbet, which matches the 
	picture. The 1/8" takes care of the with of the blade and adds 1/16" for fitting the 
	picture.
</p>

<p>
	The jig was used to cut the four sides of the frame based on the size of the picture, 
	9&nbsp;9/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;15&nbsp;5/16". But the 3/8" of inserts increases the longer 
	sides accordingly. After using the miter cutting jig the frame was glued up as seen 
	below.
</p>

<p>
	The picture frame was popped out of the framing jig. It is darn near perfect!. The 
	picture seen in the frame in the second photo does not really fit. The frame is about 
	1/16" too short for the picture. So much for perfection. The excess insert was cut 
	away with a knife and a chisel. The picture then fit tightly.

	The spline jig was used to cut the dadoes for splines. The frame was clamped to the 
	jig with two spring clamps. The blade was set to cut about 1/4" from the back of 
	the frame and about 5/8" deep. All four dadoes were quickly cut. A scrap of 3/4" 
	walnut had a 1/8" strip cut off to use as splines. The splines were cut to length 
	and glued into the corner dadoes. After drying the splines were sawed off, scraped 
	and sanded flush. The corners were cleaned up as needed. Restained the corners and 
	tried to blend the stain in. The photo shows spline dado cutting.

	Both the frame and the back of the marquetry piece were painted with two coats of 
	lacquer. After the first coat on the back I remembered to sign the piece. Unfortunately, 
	the second coat of lacquer made the Sharpie ink run. The picture is a tight fit in 
	the frame, but it will still be held by two screws with washers. These were installed. 
	Two washers of different sizes were used. The larger one, needed to span the distance, 
	had a hole too large for the head of the screw, so a smaller one was used to reduce 
	the hole size. A card was made up and glued to the back. Two eyes were screwed into 
	the frame 3" from the top and a wire strung between them for hanging. This completed 
	the project with two weeks to spare.
