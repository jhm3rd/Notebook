<p class=first>
	An interesting puzzle was seen on the 
	<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2975065">internet by WildRoseBuilds</a>. 
	The example shown was 3D printed. It consists of a cube cut into 
	three identical pieces that slide together in an interesting fashion. The puzzle 
	included plans in FreeCAD format. All I have been able to do with the plan is 
	view it from various angles in both orthographic and perspective views. The three 
	identical parts would be easiest to make from two subunits. One is a simple square 
	beveled on two adjacent sides at a 45&deg; angle. (The backside green & blue and 
	bottom red parts in the picture below.) The other subunit is significantly 
	more complex. In fact it wasn't until three or four days of trying to understand 
	its shape that I finally realized there was an almost hidden 45&deg; angle in one 
	place. The angle is on the bottom of the projection connecting the two subunits. 
	This is seen in the third picture below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Cube revealing angle.png" alt="Cube with hidden angle" width="1164" height="1432">

<p>
	Metal was purchased, but due to the challenges of making this part the project 
	began with a wooden prototype. The sizes of all dimensions were fractions of the 
	overall cube size. A cube size of 1.75" has 1.3125", 0.875", and 0.4375" lengths 
	for all of its various features. Angles are always 45&deg;. A length of 1/2" thick 
	wood was cut to 1.75" and then further cut into 1.75" squares. Two adjacent edges 
	were cut at a 45&deg; angle by tilting the milling table head. The thickness was 
	then reduced to 0.435". (Slightly below stated thickness to make sure there was 
	sliding room.)
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Cube plans.png" alt="Cube plans" width="860" height="1392">

<p>
	Baltic birch plywood (3/4" thick) was glued up and cut to produce four 1 3/8" 
	cubes. These cubes were reduced to 1.310" cubes with the mill. The appropriate 
	cutting plan was sketched on the faces of these cubes.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Cubes marked.jpg" alt="Cubes marked with cutting areas" width="2342" height="2579">

<p>
	The first cube was mounted in the milling vise on parallels. The vise was indicated 
	after aligning with the square. It was less 0.001" out of alignment! The top and 
	side were 'found' with the end mill and the end mill was lowered 0.200". The end 
	mill was moved sideways 0.100" and the first cut was taken down the side of the 
	cube. Successive cuts were taken to fit the design. This was repeated on other 
	faces until the shape was complete except for the four angled cuts. This milling 
	was repeated with three more cubes. (One for just in case!)
</p>

<p class="note">
	The picture below has a mistake. The angle indicated on the top small cube should 
	run perpendicular to that shown.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Cube rough cut.jpg" alt="Cube rough cut" width="1258" height="1228">

<p>
	The next order of business is cutting the four angles on each block. With these cut 
	the blocks should assemble into a cube.
</p>

<p>
	The extended corner that comes to a point was cut first. With the milling head set 
	to 45&deg; the block was clamped high on the angle plate with the aid of two 
	machinist's clamps. Then the end mill could be touched off on the flat face and 
	the angle milled. Rotating the part 90&deg; allowed the adjacent side to be 
	similarly milled.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Cube angles.jpg" alt="Cutting angled point on cube" width="2343" height="2110">

<p>
	The final angle had to be milled with the use of the angle plate. After doing this 
	to all four blocks assembly was attempted. There are two errors in the blocks as 
	milled. One is an error of commission. The angle on the part that attaches the 
	two subparts together was milled the wrong way. The second is an error of omission. 
	One of the two angles cut on the protruding point needs to be continued across the 
	center of the part. So additional wooden cubes need to be remade for testing these 
	new cuts. Additionally, a lot of thought needs to go into holding and milling in 
	order to transfer the knowledge learned on the wooden parts to cutting the metal 
	subassemblies.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Arrrgh! I thought I was done generating sawdust!! Of course, that is why I did a 
	prototype in wood. I am wearing a dust mask, while milling these parts.
</p>

<p>
	When milling the complex subpart, significant thought needs to go into the order 
	of milling to maximize the surface being held in the vise or clamps. The hole 
	should be drilled in the complex subpart immediately after squaring up the 
	cube. Otherwise it will be challenging to find a good corner for measuring. Using 
	a jig for drilling this hole and the mating hole in the other subpart will 
	maximize accuracy. 
</p>

<p>
	Three new 1 3/8" cubes were glued up and squared up to size. Three series of cuts 
	gave blocks similar to that shown above on the red lid. Then two angled cuts were 
	made with the block held in the vise. These two cuts are both from either side of 
	the center projection down. (As seen from the block posed on the red lid above.) 
	The angles on the two projections were cut next. The doubly cut projection was 
	held in the clamps on the angle plate and the projection that attaches to the 
	other part was held in clamps on the angle plate on the sine plate. (per the 
	following photo)
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Cube cutting setup.jpg" alt="Setup for cutting angle on connecting projection" width="3024" height="4032">

<p>
	This leaves one final cut to make. This is an inside cut. It can be seen in the 
	"Front" and "Bottom" orthographic views above or sketched on the wooden part 
	in the photo below. The wood to be removed to the left of the frontmost pencil 
	line needs to be cut back to the angle of the projection. The wood between the 
	two lines must be cut back to a hidden line that runs from the top end of the 
	rightmost line to the bottom end of the leftmost line. It may be possible to do 
	the cuts with end mills in exactly that order. Setting up for the angles will 
	require a holding fixture of some sort.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Inside angle.jpg" alt="Portraying the inside angle to be cut" width="3024" height="4032">

<p class=note>
	I can't believe how blind I have been! This inside cut is much simpler than I 
	believed. Looking at the above picture simply take all of the volume with two 
	lines and remove it. Down to the brown layer with the stripe and back to the back 
	right corner. I had been fooled by a line, that I would have expected to be a 
	change in angle in the FreeCad display. The picture below, halfway between bottom 
	view and left side views, clearly shows the offending line.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Offending line.png" alt="View with bogus line" width="1242" height="986">

<p>
	So let's mill it off and validate the truth of my new vision. Ah, the sweet taste 
	of success. The three subparts fit reasonably well. Interestingly, there are two 
	gaps in the the internal cube. The final assembly and partial disassemblies are 
	shown below. The latter two highlight the 'holes' in the inner cube.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Corner hole.jpg" alt="Corner hole upon assembly" width="3024" height="4032">

<img class=inline src="images/Internal hole.jpg" alt="Internal hole upon assembly" width="1846" height="1865">

<img class=inline src="images/Slider cube wood.jpg" alt="Wooden slider cube assembled" width="1595" height="1728">

<p>
	I am guessing that if I had cut off the marked part as originally planned there 
	might not be a middle hole. Looking at these pieces in the partial assembly leads 
	me to believe that they would also still slide past each other.
</p>

<p>
	Returning to this puzzle in February, 2021. After studying the pieces for some time 
	this morning I have a good feel for the required shape. The pieces as made have two 
	volumes missing. The first is in front of the triangle post. It is a two-sided hill 
	sloping down and away from the juncture of the triangle post and the slope coming up 
	to meet it. The second is an extension from the top of the triangle post. This is a 
	small two sloped wedge that will fit with the same sloped wedges from the other two 
	pieces and fill a cubic hole that is currently missing. I have sketched out five 
	views of this "new" piece as seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Slider cube new plan.jpg" alt="Slider cube improved plan" width="1274" height="1533">

<p>
	I also decided it was time to jump to a metal version after determining how I might 
	approach cutting each of the angles. Assembling a group of small pieces was considered, 
	but was ultimately rejected. It would be too hard to hold for the final finishing to 
	size cuts. So I am planning to mill most of the piece out of one block. A second 
	part will be made and attached. At this point I also plan to utilize the three 
	outside faces made from oak. So the aluminum central part will need to be attached 
	to the oak when completed.
</p>

<p>
	Three 1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;3/8" lengths of aluminum were cut from a 
	square bar. Each of the pieces was held in the vise with a finished side against a 
	vertical parallel, while one end was faced square and flat with a fly cutter. The 
	pieces were turned over and set on parallels in the vise. The opposite end was then 
	faced to length, 1.31". The three faced parts are shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC faced blocks.jpg" alt="Slider cube faced blocks" width="1056" height="833">

<p>
	The sides of the blocks were then faced, removing approximately 1/16" from each face. 
	The milling was done with a 5/16" four flute cutter in 0.020"&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.200 
	passes. Over a 2&nbsp;1/2 hour period two of the blocks were milled to 
	0.875""&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.875". These are shown in the picture below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC reduced blocks.jpg" alt="Two slider cubes milled to size" width="841" height="823">

<p>
	The third block was reduced to size like the previous two. The faces of the blocks 
	were marked and one end was selected as the bottom. The three blocks were then 
	marked out for the first cut. This cut removed one-half of one end to a depth of 
	7/16". This cut can be seen in the plan above in sections C & D, labeled 1. The 
	corner was first removed with a hacksaw and then cleaned up to the correct depth, 
	0.438", in both directions by milling.
</p>

<p>
	The second cut is a 45&deg; angled cut. This cut runs from the A face to the D 
	face. The point of the angle is 0.438" down from the top and 0.438" in from the 
	side. This point was marked and a line drawn from it to the top left corner on the 
	A face. A point was measured and marked 0.825" down from the top on the left side. 
	A second line was drawn from this new point back to the vertex of the angle. This 
	layout is seen in the first photo below. The hacksaw was again used to remove most 
	of the waste as shown in the second photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC second cut sawed.jpg" alt="Slider cubes first angle cut" width="1959" height="1237">

<p>
	A short pause was taken to make an adapter for the dial test indicator. I needed a 
	way to attach it to a shaft in the spindle to set the part at 45&deg;. A 2&nbsp;1/2" 
	length of 3/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2" aluminum was cut off and the ends were milled 
	square. A through hole was drilled 3/16" from one end centered on the 3/8" face with 
	a #21 drill. It was tapped 10-32. A second hole was drilled on the same face, but 
	3/16" from the opposite end. This hole was drilled through with a #21 drill and then 
	opened for half its depth with a 7/32" drill. The bottom of this hole was also tapped 
	10-32. The final hole was drilled through the 1/2" face with a 15/64" drill and 
	reamed 1/4". It was located 1/2" from the end and on center. The last task was using 
	the hacksaw to cut through the end of the bar, through the half-tapped hole and to 
	the 1/4" hole. One 10-32 screw was installed to squeeze the 1/4" hole tight around 
	a 1/4" shaft in a mill collet. A second 10-32 screw and washer were used to hold the 
	indicator in place. The picture below shows it in use.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DTI mill holder.jpg" alt="Holder for the DTI" width="1442" height="1900">

<p>
	The DTI was put to use and it verified that the angle set by the combination square 
	was accurate. (Later the DTI was used to tram the mill. It was off by 0.004" over 
	about 6" in the X-direction. Removing the paper I had placed over the riser block 
	brought it back within 0.001". It was within 0.001" in the Y-direction as well.) I 
	set the tip of the mill by eye onto the top knife edge of the part. The end mill 
	was lowered 0.015" per pass. Once the end mill reached the saw cut bottom it was 
	moved to the left edge and the bottom was gradually cut over to the vertical wall with 
	0.020" depth of cut. The end mill was lowered a total of 0.619" and met the inscribed 
	line. The milling was very slow as light cuts were a requirement. Otherwise the part 
	would move in the vise. I am not sure how to hold the part more effectively.
</p>

<p>
	I decided that a custom vee block is needed. It will have holes so the parts can be 
	screwed to the vee block and the block will be clamped to the table or the angle 
	plate as needed. The vee block needs to be clamped securely so it will have clamping 
	pads on the sides. After checking the angle plate it will need to be drilled and 
	tapped for one extra hole. The part will need to be held in two perpendicular 
	orientations for two different cuts. The angle plate is only designed to hold things 
	(vise) in one direction. To fit between two current holes in the angle plate the jig 
	will be a total of 1&nbsp;15/16" long. The clamping tabs will each be 3/8" high and 
	wide. The clamping tabs are designed to use the same clamps that hold the vise. A 
	picture of the plan is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC jig plan.jpg" alt="Plan for the jig" width="2083" height="983">

<p>
	A 2" length of 1" square aluminum bar was cut with the band saw. The ends were faced 
	square and to length, 1&nbsp;15/16". The ends were marked at 3/8" for the tabs. The 
	waste was cut out with a hacksaw and then the parts were milled to the marked lines. 
	The vee was roughly marked on the ends of the bar and it was back to the hacksaw. 
	Clamping the jig was done thoughtfully. First the jig was not evenly clamped 
	top to bottom so a thin piece of cardboard was used. The angle was set with the DTI. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	When using the DTI in this fashion it is important that the spindle does not 
	rotate. Any rotation will obscure the result. In this case a bit of folded cardboard 
	was inserted between the pulley and the housing. This was sufficient to keep the 
	spindle fixed when the DTI was used. Additionally, the DTI spindle is raised during 
	table movement and then set back down against the object measured.
</p>

<p>
	Two machinist's clamps were used as stops to keep the jig from rotating 
	during the cuts. With the jig clamped the vertical face was cut in 0.25" sections 
	in 0.005-0.010" deep passes. Then the horizontal surface was cut in 0.020" passes. 
	After completing the vee groove two holes were drilled. The holes were drilled 0.23" 
	from the bottom of the vee, 1/2" apart and 5/32" in from the sides. They were drilled 
	with a center drill followed by a #21 drill and then tapped 10-32. The clamped jig 
	is shown in the first shot below and the finished jig in the second. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC jig clamped.jpg" alt="The jig clamped for milling the vee groove" width="1788" height="1520">
<img class=inline src="images/SC jig finished.jpg" alt="The finished jig" width="1120" height="1025">

<p>
	To transfer holes to the parts is not as simple as I had first thought. I cannot use 
	the jig as a drill guide. It is too difficult to hold it at the proper angle. Also 
	the holes that have been tapped eventually need to be through holes. However, I can 
	make temporary use of the threads. A 10-32 screw was held in the lathe and its end 
	was cut to a point. It was screwed into one hole with a part clamped in place. It 
	left a decent divot. This part was clamped in the vise against a vertical parallel 
	as a stop. It was center drilled, drilled with a #21 drill, and tapped 10-32. This 
	was repeated on the other two parts. The table was moved 0.50" and the second holes 
	were drilled and tapped as well.
</p>

<p>
	Completion of the jig and putting the screw holes in the parts allowed me to finish 
	cutting the two parts similarly to the first, but with much better rigidity. The 
	setup for these cuts is shown in the photo below. When the screws were tightened, the 
	part was not pressed against the back of the vee. Using a set of thickness gauges it 
	was discovered that the gap was 0.016". So the parts were clamped with this gauge in 
	place. Aligning the jig with the angle plate is not simple. I will need to find a 
	better way to do this. Milling went better with a shot of WD-40.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC using the jig.jpg" alt="The finished jig in use" width="1240" height="1416">

<p>
	After studying the problem for some time I believe I have figured out how to make 
	the four remaining cuts. Only two require the use of the jig. The first cut that 
	needs to be made is to cut off the corner of the tower. The foremost corner shown in 
	the photo below needs to be cut off straight down to the plane to its right. The 
	vise will be turned 45&deg; for this cut. The second cut on the tower is also made 
	with the vise at a 45&deg; angle. Clamping from the A to D faces aligns the three 
	points defining the plane of this cut. This can also be imagined from the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC tower cuts.jpg" alt="Two cuts on the tower" width="964" height="1007">

<p>
	There are no compound cuts needed to finish!. The jig is needed and requires a slight 
	modification for the fourth cut. With the part set in the jig as shown in the photo 
	below the three points that define the cutting plane for the third cut are all at the 
	same level. These points are the frontmost corner, the juncture of the three planes 
	(center), and the juncture of the two dotted lines in the back. Clamping for this cut 
	uses one of the two holes drilled in the bottom on the A side. Since the E side is 
	down a second hole has to be added.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC central cut 1.jpg" alt="The first central cut" width="1337" height="1833">

<p>
	The final cut is also a central cut, just the opposite side of the part from the cut 
	outlined above. The proper alignment for this cut is shown in the next photo. The 
	three points defining this cutting plane are the foremost juncture of three dotted 
	lines, the juncture of three planes at the back of the blued area, and the point 
	where the solid line meets the back. The first two points are shared by these last 
	two cutting planes. This setup in the jig also reuses one hole in the jig and requires 
	a new hole on the C edge of the bottom face. The jig will need to be turned 45&deg; 
	to avoid milling the column face that is implied by the two hatched faces in the 
	picture below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC central cut 2.jpg" alt="The second central cut" width="1163" height="1527">

<p>
	The first of the remaining four cuts was tackled this morning. Each part was marked 
	with a Sharpie and then roughly cut with a hacksaw. The vise was set at 45&deg; for 
	these cuts. The mill vise was then set at 45&deg; with a combination square. Each 
	part was clamped, the z-axis was set to zero with the end mill touching the top, the 
	vertical face was milled, and then the horizontal face was milled to a depth of 
	0.438". Again the WD-40 was helpful on the 0.020" deep horizontal face cuts. The 
	picture below shows these cuts completed.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC cut 1.jpg" alt="The first of the last four cuts complete" width="1687" height="1077">

<p>
	The next cut is also on this top column. It can be seen in the photo above, where 
	the central part is marked on the back of the top side. It is 90&deg; from the first 
	cut. It proceeded just as the cut above with clamping in the vise still set at 
	45&deg;, but without the removing any waste with the hacksaw. All three parts were 
	cut quickly. The first picture below shows the setup and the second, three completed 
	cuts.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SC cut 2.jpg" alt="The second of the last four cuts complete" width="1332" height="1128">

<p>
	A second hole was drilled on the E side of the bottom. When setting the part in the 
	jig for the third cut the E side is on the hole side of the vee. One hole had a 
	screw installed and the other hole was punched. This punch mark was center drilled, 
	drilled #21, and tapped 10-32. This was repeated for the other two parts. A part 
	was installed in the jig and the jig was attached to the angle plate. The plate was 
	squared to the table and the jig was squared to the plate. The end mill was touched 
	off on top of the section to be cut and 0.020" cuts were made with WD-40 as lubricant. 
	The milling was stopped when the surface reached the inside corner. The setup can be 
	seen in the first photo below. The second photo shows the three parts with the third 
	cut complete.

	The part was returned to the jig but with a new face on the hole side. As before one 
	hole aligned and had a screw installed. The other hole was transferred to the part 
	with a 7/32" transfer punch. This punch mark was center drilled and tapped as above. 
	As soon as the first part was placed in the jig and on the angle plate a new 
	challenge was discovered. Cutting past the tower is not simple as the previous cut. 
	The tower angles away from the cut in two directions. So the cut was made in steps 
	away from the tower as the end mill dropped lower. The first picture below shows the 
	roughly cut first part and the second shows the filed part. The last two show the 
	three completed parts: the separated parts and the parts put together. This last 
	photo indicates that the parts need a little more material removed in order to fit 
	well.

	The next part to make is the part that sits along the bottom of the E side. This 
	part is 1&nbsp;5/16" long with a 7/16" square cross section. It comes to a point in 
	one corner. This is most easily seen in the ninth picture from the top. I found a 
	length of 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" brass bar in the garage. A 3" length was cut off. This 
	length was cut into two 1&nbsp;1/2" lengths and each of these was sawed down the 
	middle. Three of these four bars were cut to size as shown below. The ends of the 
	parts were cut off at a 45&deg; angle with a hacksaw. Then the spindle was set at 
	45&deg; with the combination square. The parts were milled first on the roughly cut 
	side, turned 90&deg; and milled on the adjacent side. The resulting three parts are 
	shown in the second photo below. I need to decide on the most appropriate way to 
	attach them to the first parts, so they look like the third photo below.

	Some cleanup activity was required on the aluminum parts. Some time was spent sanding 
	the last cut. It is difficult to get it flush with the upper part of the column. I 
	decided to plug all of the holes in the bottom that were required for jig use. I made 
	12 small threaded rods from aluminum. A 1/4" rod was chucked with about 5/8" 
	protruding from the chuck. It was faced and reduced to 0.190" for about 1/2". The 
	end was chamfered with a file. It was threaded 10-32 with the tailstock die holder. 
	About 5/16" of this was parted off. WD-40 was important for all of the steps. The 
	process was repeated 11 times. The photo shows the screws in their respective holes. 
</p>

<p>
	The screws were removed from the twelve holes and a drop of Loctite 538 was added to 
	the hole. The screws were installed and tightened with a pair of needle nose pliers. 
	The glue was allowed to dry for about 24 hours. The protruding screws were sanded off 
	on the belt sander leaving about 1/16". I don't trust my skills with this machine to 
	go any farther. The remainder was removed with the two flute cutter in 0.005" 
	increments. The photo shows the acceptable result. It probably would have been better 
	to use studs.
</p>

<p>
	The plan for joining the aluminum and brass parts is with two 1/2" long studs. Six 
	1/2" lengths of 1/8" (0.1255") brass rod were cut with a hacksaw. The rods were 
	within 0.010" of 0.500" except for two that needed 1/32" removed. The ends were all 
	chamfered in the lathe. The parts were located with an edge finder. Holes were 
	drilled 1/4" (and 5/8") from the back end and 7/32" from the bottom to a depth of 
	0.265". The holes were reamed to 0.125". The photo below shows all of the parts 
	completed and ready for assembly. Decided that I didn't want both parts to be a 
	press fit so the holes in the brass were opened up to 0.128 with a #30 drill.
</p>

<p>
	The pins were pressed into the aluminum parts in a vise using the brass parts as 
	guides. Epoxy was made up and a small amount was placed in the holes in the brass 
	and on its mating surface. The parts were pressed together with a pinch clamp. The 
	aluminum parts with the pins pressed in and the clamped parts are shown below. The 
	epoxy takes at least 24 hours to harden, maybe more in the cold basement.

<p>
	After allowing the epoxy to harden it was on to the next step. I only had two of the 
	original three wooden parts. A 1/2" thick piece of oak was cut to 
	1.75"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1.75" on the table saw. First, the thickness of the block was 
	reduced to 0.439" in the mill with the two flute cutter. Then the milling head was 
	tilted to 45&deg; and the two adjacent edges were mitered with the same cutter. 
	Carpet tape was cut to attach the wooden part to the top of the aluminum column. 
	The pictures below show this part of the story.

<p>
	Do the parts still go together after my modifications to the plans? They do not seem 
	to want to slide together. It may be that the puzzle only works if the cube is not 
	completely full. It may require gaps so the pieces will slide together. Thus it is 
	not a true dissection puzzle. It is not clear which modification has resulted in an 
	obstruction. There is also a slim possibility that insufficient clearance is the 
	culprit.
</p>

<p>
	Decided to leave things as they are and complete a cubic dissection, even if it is 
	no longer a puzzle. So all that remains is attaching the wood and finishing it. The 
	angle plate was set up on the mill along with a cylindrical parallel. A block of 
	waste wood was set in this corner. The wood was approximately marked for the two 
	holes. The drill was aligned with one and the hole was drilled through with a 7/32" 
	drill. This was repeated on the other two wooden parts. The drill was changed to a 
	#21 drill and the aluminum part was clamped in place with a machinist's clamp. It 
	was drilled 0.40" deep. The other aluminum parts were drilled the same way. The 
	wooden part was returned to this same setup and the hole was countersunk with a 7/16" 
	drill approximately 3/16" deep. Again this was repeated on the other two parts. The 
	holes in the aluminum were tapped 10-32. Six screws were cut to size. The other 
	holes were drilled similarly but closer to the opposite corner. The first photo shows 
	the drilling setup and the second shows the three joined pieces.

	After disassembly the wood was sanded, stained and varnished. The three parts were 
	assembled. The two pictures below show the final result.
