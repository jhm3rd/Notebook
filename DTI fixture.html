<p class=first>
	When making the optical center punch a round part needed to be centered precisely 
	under the mill spindle, a perfect job for the dial test indicator, if there was a 
	good way of holding it off axis. I had nothing to manage this feat, so will make one.
</p>

<p>
	The fixture will consist of two parts, a bar that will be held in the mill collet 
	and a slide that will hold the DTI to the bar. The bar was tackled first after 
	figuring out how best to insure the bar was centered with the stub for the collet.
</p>

<p>
	A 2" length of 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" steel was located in the scrap bin. It was first 
	marked and then cut into an L-shape with a hacksaw. Two faces were cleaned up in the 
	mill, the inside of the long arm and the end of the short. The L was held in the 
	four jaw chuck on the South Bend lathe. It was carefully centered in one direction 
	so the short leg of the L was centered side-to-side, using a dial indicator mounted 
	in the QCTP. The stub was reduced until it was a sliding fit in the mill's collet 
	(0.375").
</p>

<p>
	The two sides of the long leg were both milled down so they were even with the 
	round stub just formed. This left the width of the bar at 0.371". The bottom was 
	then milled so the total height of the bar ended at 0.375" as well after a bit of 
	sanding. The free end was heavily chamfered with a file. The resulting bar is seen 
	below.

<p>
	A 1&nbsp;1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2" scrap of brass was located in the 
	bin to use for the slide. The two ends were cleaned up in the mill. The piece was 
	marked for drilling the through hole and for the ensuing square hole. It was drilled 
	in the vise up to 3/8" after beginning the hole with the spotting drill. This is 
	shown below.
</p>

<p>
	The corners were filed using a three corner file. The bar now slides easily through 
	the slide. The slide on the bar is shown below.

<p>
	The slide was returned to the milling vise and located with the edge finder. A hole 
	was drilled for the DTI shaft up to a #22 drill, 0.156" providing a decent sliding 
	fit. Two holes were then cross drilled and tapped 6-32, one for the bar and one for 
	the DTI shaft. After a bit of cleanup the completed slide is shown in the first 
	photo below. The second photo shows the fixture assembled with the DTI installed.
