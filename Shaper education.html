<p class=first>
	The Atlas 7B Shaper arrived about four months ago now. Each time it has been started 
	it shorts out. The problem is the new switch that was installed. The attached wires 
	were the source of the short, so the first fix was wrapping them in electrician's 
	tape. This did not short out as quickly, but eventually shorted out after a few 
	minutes of movement. The gap between the main driving gear and the back of the switch 
	is small and this switch has terminals sticking out the back.
</p>

<img class=inline src="shaper/Shaper switch.jpg" alt="Shaper switch" width="1732" height="1811">

<p>
	A new switch was purchased from Ace Hardware with two wires coming out of one end. 
	These wires were shortened. Both these wires and the motor wires were bared and 
	joined with wire nuts. A little measuring showed that there was sufficient room in 
	front of the main gear to fit the switch and the nuts. The nuts were taped to the 
	back of the switch with electrician's tape. The switch was installed with the ground 
	wire trapped between the machine and the switch plate. The machine was run without 
	shorting out.
</p>

<p>
	Learning how to use the shaper was the next task. A few books are available, one 
	purchased and two downloaded pdfs. Setting the length of stroke is the first task. 
	This is done with a crank handle attached to a square shaft on the just below the 
	switch inside of a knurled knob. The length of stroke should be the length of the 
	material plus 1/4" at the front of the workpiece and 1/8" at the back of the work. 
	The handle/lock at the top of the shaper is then released. A square ended shaft is 
	to its right and turning this adjusts the position of the shaper cutting tool. After 
	setting the stroke length, the shaper was manually moved to the rightmost or stroke 
	beginning. This was adjusted so the cutting tool was 1/4" from the front edge of the 
	workpiece. 
</p>

<p>
	The worktable can be moved back and forth by a square ended shaft with a graduated 
	dial just to the left and below the switch. It was adjusted so the tool was just in 
	front of the workpiece. The tool height is adjusted in small increments by the 
	handle on top. It was adjusted to just touch the top of the small block in the 
	vise. The machine was started and the handle for tightening the belts was pushed 
	to the right engaging the head movement. To engage the crossfeed a small knob is 
	turned counterclockwise (a clockwise turn causes the table to move away from the 
	operator) causing the table to move toward the operator. Cutting was good, though 
	the cuts were too far apart. Learning how to adjust this movement is the next lesson.
</p>

<p>
	Noticed that black dust was accumulating below the belt on the back side of the 
	shaper. This is the belt that connects the large top pulley to the small bottom 
	pulley. I had thought these two pulleys were sufficiently aligned. Using a straight 
	edge indicated the bottom pulley needed to move away from the shaper about 1/16". 
	The pulley was adjusted as indicated.
</p>

<p>
	A cheat sheet was made for the shaper. It has a diagram of the shaper indicating 
	all of the 'knobs' that can be adjusted to affect cutting. Each is labeled with 
	a letter and a phrase describes the utility of that knob. Also indicated on the 
	diagram are the various places where oil should be applied (and one for grease). 
	Now that the winter is past this should be the first order of business before 
	beginning work on either the South Bend carriage stop or tool holder. 
</p>

<p>
	Spent some time this morning (6/5) continuing to learn how to use the shaper. 
	The first challenge was adjusting the length of stroke. The large knurled nut 
	was loosened with some effort and the shaft in its center was rotated clockwise 
	(about one turn per 1/4" additional stroke). The knurled nut is then tightened. 
	The handle on top is loosened and the shaft on top is then rotated to move the 
	beginning of the cut to the correct position. A few times back and forth gave 
	the right length of cut with sufficient overlap at both ends. Then the distance 
	of automatic movement of the table was adjusted. The only way I know to do this 
	is to loosen the nut on the eccentric and move this nut in or out relative to 
	the center of the eccentric wheel. It was adjusted to give a small movement. I 
	am guessing about 0.005" (bad guess, it is about 0.010"). The tee nut is 
	difficult to slide and may require some lubrication.
</p>

<p class=note>
	There has to be a better way to make this adjustment!! The scale on the table 
	movement shaft might indicate that this is where this is done, but I have yet 
	to figure it out. Nope, as seen on YouTube this is the only way to adjust this 
	movement. You should be able to read out the distance moved on the scale as the 
	movement takes place on the return stroke.
</p>

<p>
	With these parameters set the down feed was set to about 0.005" and cutting 
	commenced. The cuts left no obvious grooves between strokes, but chatter could 
	be seen and felt across the face of the work.
</p>

<p>
	I read the Kay Fisher columns on Shaper tools. The tool I am using may be part 
	of the problem. It is a right knife tool, which is usually used for vertical 
	cuts on the side of the work. I need to make a round nose tool with no rake. 
	The Armstrong tool holder will provide the 14&deg; rake and the grinding should 
	provide about 7&deg; clearance if the bottom of the tool is aligned with the wheel 
	center. This is a multipurpose tool used for roughing and finish cuts. It is 
	the most commonly used tool as it will cut in both directions, eliminating the 
	need to move the table back by hand after each pass.
</p>

<p>
	I ground a round nose tool from a Sherline HSS blank. After grinding it needed 
	cleanup on the ground face. This was done with 150 grit paper and left a pretty 
	decent finish on the ground curved face. The top face was slightly ground 
	(maybe it should have been left alone) and then sanded with 150 grit, honed 
	with 220 and 320 grit and finally sanded with 1500 grit paper. This left a nice 
	polish on the top face.
</p>

<p>
	This new bit was put in the Armstrong holder, which was placed as far into the 
	lantern tool post as possible. A couple of cuts across the part, advancing 
	about 0.010" per pass and a depth of 0.003-0.005", resulted in significant 
	chatter. The fern-like finish can be seen in the left photo below. The round 
	nose tool was extended almost 1" from the holder and its vibration during 
	cutting was fairly obvious. So this tool was cut in half with a Dremel and 
	cutting wheel. The shortened version was returned to the Armstrong tool holder 
	exposing about 3/8". No vibration could be seen, but as the photo on the 
	right shows there was still a lot of chatter.
</p>

<p>
	Reading up on Shaper chatter it seems as if I should continue to work on sharpening 
	the round nose bit. The front or bottom face should probably be sanded to a finer 
	grit. A leather strop may also be helpful. I should also explore different feed 
	rates, especially slower feeds. Maybe even use real cutting fluid instead of the 
	oil I tried because it was handy.
</p>

<p>
	A few new things were tried. After a little consideration the clearance might 
	not be sufficient. The Armstrong tool holder angles the tool at > 7&deg; and 
	the clearance is only 7&deg;. The heel of the tool looked very close to contacting 
	the work upon visual inspection. So I increased the angle of the table on the 
	grinder and reground the clearance. I then carefully sanded the clearance and 
	the top face of the tool with successively 150, 220, 320, 400, 600, 1000, & 1500 
	grit sand paper. Cutting then proceeded as before. There was little change in 
	the amount of chatter as seen in photo lower left. I then lowered the speed one 
	step (the lowest the machine can go). Chatter was improved as seen in the lower 
	right photo (0.005" depth of cut). The picture below shows the improvement. It 
	is still not as smooth as it should be. Oil, cutting depth of 0.007", of 0.002" 
	resulted in no improvement. Difficult to see in the lower left photo is the 
	"bump" in cutting at the beginning of the cut. This was not affected by any of 
	the modifications discussed above.
