<p class=first>
	<a href="www.edgetechnologyproducts.com">Edge</a> makes a nice indicator holder for 
	the lathe that fits a QCTP. Now that I have a QCTP I decided to make a holder that 
	mimics the Edge holder. A piece of 3/8" aluminum was cut to a 2.75" square. A 
	matching piece of 3/8" steel was found that is 3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2.75". The indicator 
	was measured at 2.165". A 2.4" circle was laid out off center on the aluminum. Indents 
	were also laid out on two adjacent corners, but were never used.
</p>

<p>
	The two smallest corners were cut off with the hack saw. A hole was drilled through 
	the aluminum up to 1/2". This hole was bored to 5/8" to accomodate the tab on the 
	back of the indicator. The hole was then bored to 2.166" to fit the 2.165" indicator.
	This boring did not go through and left about 1/16" of material on the back.
</p>

<p>
	The outside work came next. The first corner was rounded with a file over a twenty 
	minute period. It was quite exhausting. After lunch I used the sanding belt. This 
	did a better job and took only about five minutes with minimal effort. The correct 
	slots were cut for the indicator pin on the table saw about 3/16" deep.

<p>
	The waste in the slots was removed with a round file. The indicator nestled firmly in
	the holder as seen in the photo below. The holder was cleaned up by sanding and the
	edges were chamfered.
</p>

<p>
	Two screws were used to hold the two parts together. The steel was marked 5/8" in 
	from the ends and the center of the 3/8" edge was marked. Punch marks were made at 
	both of these locations. A center drill was used to start the holes. The holes were 
	drilled through for a 10-32 screw using a 7/32" drill in the drill press. The holes 
	were opened to fit the socket head with a 5/16" drill to a 3/8" depth. The holes 
	were transferred to the aluminum holder. These holes were center drilled, drilled 
	3/4" deep with a #21 drill, and tapped 10-32. The holes were cleaned out with 
	compressed air. The first photo shows the completed parts and the second shows the 
	assembled indicator holder. Last but not least is a photo of the holder with 
	indicator 'mounted' on the lathe.

<p class="note">
	The indicator rotates freely in the holder as the slots were made too wide. This 
	will need to be corrected somehow.
</p>

<p>
	A nice 8-32 set screw was discovered. A hole was drilled in the side of the housing 
	with a #29 drill. It was tapped 8/32. After deburring the hole the lightly filed set 
	screw was installed. The photo below shows the completed indicator holder.
