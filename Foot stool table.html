<p class=first>
	I have wanted a work table for some time. I need a place to keep notes, use the 
	computer, assemble small projects, etc. A table against the wall that could drop 
	down out of the way was considered, but it would not be usable on a daily basis. 
	Currently, the large foot stool is used as a table as it is right in front of the 
	chair. This provided the idea to simply make a table that sits on top of the foot 
	stool. This would provide a few benefits. It would be higher. It could have a few 
	drawers and a slide-out computer rest. It would be level. It could serve as a writing 
	table and assembly table. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Foot stool.jpg" alt="Current foot stool table" width="4032" height="2596">

<p>
	The top cushion on the foot stool is 22" X 43". Two corners will need corner brackets 
	to keep the table from shifting to the side or front to back. A 4' X 8' sheet of 3/4" 
	baltic birch is waiting in the garage for some use having been extra material for the 
	dodecahedron library. The car is in the body shop for repairs after a recent accident 
	so now is the ideal time to cut up this large sheet into parts for a useful cause. 
	The table will consist of two layers of the baltic birch separated by about 4". This 
	space will house two drawers and a slide-out shelf. These three items will not use up 
	the entire 22" of depth so the back will be left open for more storage. One never has 
	enough space to store unused crap! 
</p>

<p>
	With the corner brackets in place the top and bottom boards will need to be 23.5" X 
	44.5". The plan is to use dadoes and rabbets for all of the parts that connect the 
	top and bottom boards. Glue and no screws are planned except for the corner brackets. 
	A crude layout is diagrammed below highlighting the dadoes and rabbets on the top and 
	bottom. Not noted on this diagram is the distance from the outside of one of the 
	vertical dadoes to the board edge. This distance is 14 37/64". 
</p>

<canvas id="drawingCanvas" width="500" height="210"></canvas>

<p>
	The plywood was laid on 2 X 4's on the garage floor with a 2 X 4 on each side of the 
	planned cut and other boards as needed to support the rest of the large sheet. Two 
	boards were cut from the Baltic Birch plywood, 23 1/2" X 48", using a circular saw 
	with an aluminum guide set 1 5/8" from the desired cut. Three 4 3/4"  X 48" boards 
	were cut the same way. Cutting the dadoes is next and poses a problem. Since the 
	top and bottom are mirror images, they cannot be cut in the same setup. The left 
	dado on the top needs to align with the right dado on the bottom.  Getting these 
	accurately cut is paramount to correct assembly. The simplest way to avoid this issue 
	is by cutting the dadoes all the way across the top and bottom. The parts are no 
	longer mirror images and all four dadoes can be cut on the same setup on the table 
	saw. By the way 3/4" Baltic Birch plywood is 0.710" (180 mm) thick.
</p>

<p>
	The center divider and the top and bottom were cut to length (44 1/2") on the table 
	saw using the crosscut sled. The dado blade set was adjusted until it measured 0.720" 
	using various shims in the set. Height was adjusted to 0.375". (Did not think it 
	necessary to modify this based on the wood thickness.) The fence was set on the left 
	side of the blade so the fence to approximate dado center was 14 1/2". (A slight 
	modification of the distances noted in the above diagram.) The miter gauge was used 
	to move the center divider past the dado blade. Each end was aligned with the fence 
	producing the two dadoes. The larger top and bottom were moved over the dado blade 
	by hand again on both ends. Accuracy in this case is dependent on accurately 
	reproducing the length of all three parts. 
</p>

<p>
	The dado blade set was then set to 0.360" with shims for the rabbets. The fence was 
	set up against the dado blade as accurately as possible. After a successful test run 
	a 48" board was run down both sides creating the rabbets on the two sides. After 
	finding the optimal location for the table saw rabbets were cut along both sides of 
	the top and bottom. The dado was returned to 0.720" and the dadoes were cut across 
	the sides and the long dadoes across the top and bottom. All parts were marked with 
	a front. The long dadoes in the top and bottom were very difficult to cut as it was 
	difficult to keep sufficient pressure on the top of the large board. As a consequence 
	these dadoes needed significant "completion" with a 1/2" chisel. There was also a 
	lot of tear out along these dadoes.
</p>

<p>
	The drawer fixtures and the computer pullout need to be installed prior to putting 
	the box together. The runners will be made from 1/2" X 1/4" stock giving these fairly 
	large drawers sufficient support. These will be placed halfway up the sides of the 
	box ends and dividers. A stop also needs to be installed for the computer pullout. 
	One or two screws through the back of the pullout will serve as the stops on the 
	shelf and can be installed once the shelf is past the stop block affixed to the top 
	of the table.
</p>

<p>
	The four drawer guides were cut from 3/4" oak, 1/4" thick and then cut to 11 1/2" 
	long. The pullout guides were also cut from 3/4" stock, but 1/2" thick. The pullout 
	guides were installed first. In order to provide a little adjustment room, the 
	through holes were drilled using a #8 wood screw drill. The matching holes in the 
	side and left divider were drilled for a #6 wood screw. Two 3/4" long #6 wood screws 
	were used to mount the pullout guides to their respective parts. They were mounted 
	flush with the front and 7/8" down from the top. This leaves a 1/8" gap when using 
	the 3/4" Baltic Birch plywood for the shelf. The four drawer guides were mounted 
	similarly, except they were mounted 1/4" back from the front and 2" from the bottom 
	of the part.
</p>

<p>
	When a dry fit was attempted it was discovered that the long center divider's dadoes 
	for the two drawer dividers were slightly off alignment with the dadoes in the top 
	and bottom. These dadoes were widened slightly with the table saw resulting in a 
	slightly loose fit. This same divider was also drilled for a cord hole. A 1 1/2" 
	hole saw was used to make this hole. A small depth was drilled and then the hole 
	saw was cleaned of the glue that built up in the teeth. Repeating this numerous 
	times gave a clean hole and a smelly basement. Dry fitting all of the parts resulted 
	in a very solid table.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Table dry assembled.jpg" alt="Table dry assembled" width="3019" height="1568">

<p>
	The bottom was placed on two boxes and glue put in the long dado and two short dadoes. 
	The three dividers were put in place, glue was placed in the top dadoes, and the 
	top was put on the dividers. Clamps were placed on the front of the two drawer 
	dividers and on both ends of the long divider. Glue was put on both of the rabbeted 
	edges of the sides and on the rabbeted edges of the top/bottom. The sides were put in 
	place and clamped vertically on corners and from end to end. The pipe clamp used an 
	extension and two bar clamps used a budgie to link them for the span. A full toolbox 
	was used to provide some "clamping" for the top and bottom in the middle. The two 
	front divider clamps had to be used for end clamping as shown in the picture below. 
	Clearly, one can never have enough clamps.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Table glue-up.jpg" alt="Table glue up" width="2549" height="1815">

<p>
	I have not decided whether to paint the table or to leave it unfinished. If it is 
	finely sanded, it might better serve as both a drawing table and assembly table. 
	Maybe a few coats of tung oil only to seal and to provide a harder surface?? The 
	runners need to be waxed and the corners need to be chamfered. The board that serves 
	as the computer slide will be made to fit about 1/16" narrower than the opening to 
	minimize its ability to get cockeyed during closing. Similarly, the drawers will 
	have minimum side-to-side clearance like the the machinist's tool chest.
</p>

<p>
	Chamfered the corners. The corner plane worked well with the grain on the short 
	sides. Sanded the top, faces and sides with the random orbit sander using 150 grit 
	paper. Took a sample of the Baltic Birch, sanded it, and finished it with tung oil 
	to see how it looks. Decided to go with the tung oil. The shelf was cut to fit the 
	opening as were the two drawer fronts. All parts had their edges rounded and were 
	sanded with 150 grit sandpaper. The box, drawer fronts, and the shelf were coated 
	with tung oil in the garage. They need to dry overnight before another coat can be 
	applied. Three coats were applied in total to all four parts.
</p>

<p>
	The shelf was completed with three operations. A 3/4" rounding bit was put in the 
	router in the table. A stop was set about 7 11/16" to the left of the bit. A mark 
	was made on the fence at 5 11/16" to the left of the bit. The fence was set 1/2" 
	back from the back edge of the bit. The shelf was held bottom down with its left 
	edge at the mark on the fence. The shelf was lowered onto the bit and then moved 
	to the left until it hit the stop. The centered groove that was made in the bottom 
	of the shelf was cleaned up with a bit of sanding. A 3/16" X 1" X 8" scrap of plywood 
	was glued across the inside top of the shelf opening about 3/8" back from the front. 
	This was clamped for 1.5 hrs. Two holes were drilled near the back edge of the shelf 
	about 5" apart and 3/8" in from the back edge. They were first drilled with a 1/4" 
	drill and followed with an "F" drill. The holes were then threaded with a 5/16"-18 
	tap. Two 1" screws were put in the holes. The shelf was inserted and the screws were 
	screwed as far as they would go. They barely touch the top of the box and do a great 
	job of stopping the shelf when it is pulled out. The screws and the glued in board 
	keep the shelf from sitting at an angle when it is pulled out.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Table & shelf.jpg" alt="Table with shelf installed" width="2864" height="2166">

<p class="note">
	The drawers were initially planned with 1/2" X 3 1/2" stock, but I could only find 
	5/8" X 3 1/2" stock at Menards. After working with this wood for a bit I discovered 
	that it is actually 1/32" thicker than 5/8"!! 
</p>

<p>
	The four sides were cut to length, 11 1/2", by aligning with a line on the crosscut 
	sled. The two backs were also cut to length on the crosscut sled, 12 15/16" and 
	14 1/8". All of the parts were carefully labeled with name, inside, and top. The 
	various cuts were also laid out on each piece. The table saw was set up with a 1/4" 
	dado blade set to 1/4" high and with a fence set 1/4" from the blade. The 
	dadoes for holding the drawer bottoms were cut on all sides, fronts, and backs. The 
	blade was raised to 3/8" to make the following cuts. Dadoes were cut on the 
	inside ends of the sides; one to fit the front and one to fit the back on each side. 
	The backs were held vertically with the inside to the fence to cut the rabbets that 
	fit into the side's dadoes. The dadoes in the ends of the fronts were cut with the 
	inside to the fence again and the fronts held vertically. The blade was raised to 
	5/8" and the cuts repeated to bring them to depth. The tabs left on the front 
	(inside) were cut off to leave the tenon to fit the 1/4" dado on the sides and 
	leaving a slightly less than 1/4" thick overlap of the front to cover the side. This 
	completed the locking mortise connecting the fronts and the backs.
</p>

<p>
	The dadoes were cut in the sides next. After a few trials in scrap the dado width 
	was set at 3/4" plus a thick spacer. The distance from the bottom of the dado to the 
	bottom of the side was set with the fence at 1 9/16". The depth was set to slightly 
	more than 1/4". The dadoes were cut on the outside of all four sides. The backs of 
	both drawers seemed to bind as the drawer was pushed in. The tenons were reduced a 
	bit so the back width matched the front. With the drawers assembled the movement was 
	constrained, but free. The bottoms were cut from 3/16" plywood. The smaller drawer 
	bottom was 10 7/8" X 12 3/8" and the larger was 10 7/8" X 13 11/16". In both cases 
	the sizes were 3/8" over the size of the opening.

	Glue was put on the outside ends of the sides and in the end dado for the large 
	drawer. The parts were placed together with the drawer bottom in place and then 
	clamped. A picture of the clamped drawer is shown below. The smaller drawer was 
	glued up similarly.

	Handles were made from a scrap of the Baltic Birch plywood. A 7 1/2" length was 
	passed by the router with a round-over bit installed to cut away part of the back 
	side. This long edge with the concave cutout was cut off with the table saw at 1". 
	The strip was then cut in half forming the two handles having a square end profile 
	with one corner cut out in a semi-circle. The handles were each marked for two 
	holes; centered top to bottom and about 1 1/2" apart. Each hole was drilled with 
	a 9/32" drill for the screw through hole. The four holes were countersunk to match 
	the screws. The handles were clamped to the drawers on center and the drawers 
	drilled through with a #7 drill. The holes in the drawers were threaded 1/4-20. The 
	handles were sanded with 150 grit paper and three coats of tung oil were applied. 
	Installing the handles with 1 1/2" long 1/4-20 screws and waxing the drawer guides 
	completed the footstool table.

	After about a year it became clear that tung oil is not sufficiently robust to use 
	as a finish on a table. There were multiple stains on the table top from coffee 
	drops and other unknown things. Consequently, I decided to refinish the top and the 
	top of the shelf. The table was emptied and moved to the wood shop. The top and shelf 
	were sanded with 220 grit paper to get rid of the stains and to prepare the wood for 
	a new finish. Shellac was brushed on and left to dry for an hour. Two more coats 
	were added, sanding lightly with 220 grit paper in between coats. Hopefully this 
	finish will better resist staining from the inevitable spills.
