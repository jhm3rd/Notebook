<p class=first>
	Made two screw cut-off jigs or clamps. The original measurements were metric, so 
	these had to be translated to imperial. 
</p>

<p class=note>
	This work was based on an article in "Home Shop Machinist" Jan/Feb, 2007.
</p>

	Both pieces of steel were clamped in the milling vise and the ends were squared. I 
	needed to decide which screw sizes wer to be cut. The following were chosen: 4-40, 
	6-32, 8-32, 10-24, 10-32, 1/4-20 with three on each cut-off jig. The first piece was 
	drilled with the appropriate tap drill sizes: #43, #36, and #29. Taps were started 
	and removed for all three holes. The tapping was completed by hand. The part was 
	held in a 1/2" open wrench. This process was repeated on the second blank with bits: 
	#25, #21, and #7. The locations for this second group of three holes were 0.18", 
	0.40", and 0.66". After all holes were drilled the burrs were filed off.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, both parts were held in the vise and milled with a 1/4" end mill for 0.625" 
	to a depth of 0.040". The slot was cut down the middle with a hacksaw. I attempted 
	to harden the parts by heating to cherry red and quenching in water with soap added. 
	They did not harden as judged by a file test, so the metal must not be the right 
	kind of steel.
