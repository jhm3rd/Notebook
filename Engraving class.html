<h4>Suggestions of Note</h4>
<p class=first>
	“Art of Engraving” by James Meeks is a top notch summary of engraving and is 
	currently on sale at Brownells. Orders from GRS over the next 3-4 weeks will receive 
	a 10% discount. Make sure to speak with the sales rep consulted when purchasing the 
	student tool set. The Firearms Engravers Guild has a show every year in Las Vegas 
	about the third week of January.
</p>

<h4>Hammer</h4>
<p>
	The hammer supplied in the kit from GRS has a fairly thick handle. Thinning this 
	with sandpaper is recommended to improve the flexibility and feel. Mike uses a pin 
	in his hammer that when used sits between the middle and fourth fingers. This serves 
	as a fixed reference to always orient the face of the hammer correctly. The hammer 
	is lightly held between the thumb and forefinger. The other three fingers are used 
	to move the hammer. This is a chasing hammer, not a claw hammer or a ball peen 
	hammer. It is moved quite differently to tap the graver in a very controlled manner. 
	<b>The wrist does not move! The forearm and elbow do not move!</b> 
</p>

<h4>Tool Geometry</h4>
<p>
	 A 90&deg; and a 120&deg; gravers came with the kit. They were neither sharpened nor 
	 completely roughed out as delivered. In addition some gravers supplied were not 
	 roughed out correctly as their points were not centered. The 120• graver is 
	 referred to as the universal graver and the 90&deg; graver as the detail graver. The 
	 angles do not have to be precisely 90 or 120. For instance the 90 can vary from 
	 90 to 105. The 120&deg; degree graver can cut both fine and thick lines. The 90 is 
	 more limited in width of line cut.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Tool geometry.jpg" alt="Graver tool geometry" width="1440" height="594">

<p>
	A flat graver is usually used for big, wide, bright cuts. To use it start on an 
	outside point, roll to the inside as cut progresses to include more metal and then 
	roll back out as the cut finishes.
</p>

<p>
	An engraver geometry used to the exclusion of other graver geometries by many master 
	engravers is called the schpietzer (or onglette). It is rounded on both sides and 
	comes to a point. It is ground to a variety of widths. There is also a round bottom 
	graver used mostly for inlaying precious metals.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Schpietzer.jpg" alt="Schpietzer" width="942" height="382">

<p>
	Engravers are made from high speed steel, HSS, tool steel (M41, M42, …) and carbide. 
	Some of the tool steels have trademarked names, e.g. Cronite.
</p>

<p>
	Sharpening the Universal and Detail tools is made simpler with sharpening jigs 
	available from GRS and Lindsay. The Lindsay sharpening system was used in class. 
	The uniform parallels ground at the very tip of the graver (as shown below) did 
	not use to be ground parallel to the edges of the tool. Two critical components 
	of grinding these gravers are that the rough 90&deg; or 120&deg; ground faces must 
	converge at the center of the graver. Also, the uniform parallels must be identical 
	or the graver will turn when used.
</p

<p>
	Using the Lindsay jigs requires that the grinding surface be 1/2” above the surface 
	that the jig slides on. Lindsay diamond hones come 1/2” thick. Similarly a power 
	hone (discussed below) comes with the appropriate height for this sharpening system. 
	The back side of these two gravers are shaped as well providing a better view of the 
	cutting face. After cutting the new faces on the graver it must finally be polished 
	with a few strokes on a diamond dust impregnated leather surface. This is 
	accomplished by spraying a suspension of diamond dust on the leather, letting it dry 
	and taking three or so strokes across the leather pad on three faces: the top or 
	45&deg; angled face, and each of the two uniform parallels.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Sharpening.jpg" alt="Sharpening diagram" width="636" height="696">

<p>
	A final adjustment before using the graver is “dubbing” the point or blunting it 
	slightly. This strengthens the point, increasing wear about 30%. It makes the chips 
	come straight up from the graver with minimal curl, so the chip stays out of the 
	line of sight. It is only done on point gravers, e.g. universal, detail, & 
	schpietzer. An Arkansas stone can be used for dubbing, but the ruby stone is 
	standard. A grit finer than 1200 should be used. To dub the tool it is held 
	vertically and lightly stroked across the stone in the shape of a ‘W’ that has 
	1/8” legs.
</p>

<p>
	A flat or wedged-shaped graver is mounted in the clear Lindsay template without the 
	indexing pin. Only the face is sharpened and this face must be square. It is 
	polished on the flat face with the diamond dust impregnated leather. 
</p>

<h4>Workholding</h4>

<p>
	Students used a Shop Fox vise which is an imported version of a Wilton Versavise. 
	Both are known as parrot vises. This vise requires constant loosening, rotating and 
	retightening to keep the work in the appropriate position for engraving. More ideal 
	is an engraver’s block. The Magna Block is the vise sold by GRS for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
	It is often best to mount the metal to be engraved on a small block of wood with 
	double sided tape. This allows for firmer work holding than the thin sides of a 
	plate. It can also elevate the workpiece above the vise jaws if needed. Mike 
	recommends Sure Tape available at Lowes or findtape.com.
</p>

<h4>Lighting</h4>

<p>
	A three LED desk lamp is recommended to provide sufficient lighting. Using one that 
	has a chromed grid or diffuser is ideal as there are no shadows. The goal is to 
	provide sufficient light even under the magnification of the Univisor, while 
	minimizing shadows and reflections from the metal surface and graver.
</p>

<h4>Using the Graver</h4>

<p>
	The graver is held firmly in the hand across the palm (left hand for right handed 
	engravers). The thumb should be pressed against the side of the graver handle. With 
	the exception of the thumb this is very similar to holding a wood chisel. The little 
	finger should wrap around the sleeve on the graver. Gravers are held in a quick 
	change (QC) collet in a handle. To improve holding and comfort a sleeve on the 
	graver is recommended. An ideal source of sleeves is silicone fuel line (for model 
	cars and planes). The graver is held at an angle to the metal to be engraved larger 
	than 15• and after starting the cut this angle is quickly reduced to the ideal 
	15&deg;. After making the cut using repeated taps with the chasing hammer the angle 
	of attack is further reduced and with one tap the chip is cut off (chipped out). The 
	graver is lubricated as needed with Oil of Wintergreen usually kept on a cotton ball 
	in a watch box or other small container.
</p>

<p>
	A style of cut called the “Cat Claw” commonly used in “Western” style or “Bright Cut” 
	style begins thin with light slow strokes. The strokes become heavier as the tool is 
	rotated and the graver is slightly rotated to the outside of the curve by about 
	3&deg;. Near the end chasing returns to light slow strokes as the cut finishes and 
	the final chip is ‘popped’ out.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Cat claw.jpg" alt="Cat claw cut" width="438" height="348">

<p>
	The Cat Claw can be made curving right or left. For right handers curving this or 
	other cuts to the right brings the hammer closer and closer to the body. This close 
	proximity can be relieved by bending at the waist and/or holding the hammer 
	increasingly vertical while striking. A similar approach is appropriate for left 
	handers cutting a right curving stroke. For right handers cutting a right curving 
	stroke start with the hammer vertical under the chin and move away from the body 
	with the hammer increasingly horizontal as the cut progresses.
</p>

<p>
	Orienting the graver at the beginning of the cut is important. One way to make sure 
	you have the best control while aligning your graver on the correct spot is to use 
	a “steady rest”. This can be the heel of your hand resting on the block or the thumb 
	of your hand on the block. Sometimes a thumb to thumb steady rest will also be 
	helpful, especially for straight cuts.
</p>

<p>
	Cutting a dot consists of pushing the corner of the flat blade into the metal and 
	turning the workpiece or moving around the workpiece without the hammer. The number 
	of complete revolutions around the center of the dot will establish its size. If 
	making multiple identical dots, use the same number of revolutions. 
</p>

<p>
	Also cut with the flat (or wedge-shaped) graver is the “wriggle” cut. This is 
	accomplished by pushing instead of chasing. Wriggle cuts can follow either straight 
	or curved lines. The holder is held in the palm and the graver is pinched between 
	the thumb and the forefinger. Take care not to reenter on a chip as the graver will 
	slide across the work surface. The wriggle cut is done by pushing the point of the 
	graver into the work and while pushing forward along the intended path, rocking the 
	graver back and forth. This rocking is accomplished by turning the wrist with the 
	elbow in a fixed position. The degree of turn to the right and left must be the 
	same. The greater the degree of turn the ‘looser’ the wriggle. The points of the 
	‘wriggle’ are somewhat emphasized. The tool is normally held at 35•. Western bright 
	cut scrolls are often formed with a wriggle cut. When using the pushing handle it 
	can be flattened on one side for improved clearance.
</p>

<h4>Using an Air Powered Tool</h4>

<p>
	The tool is held in your dominant hand and the other hand manipulates the block. The 
	block is turned with the whole hand. Never finger turn a block! Turn the block, stop 
	when you begin to feel uncomfortable, readjust the block, and start cutting again. 
	The hand holding the graver never changes position during a long cut. Never remove 
	the tool from the cut. Unlike using a vise the work moves past a steady cutter held 
	tight to a flat surface. Fingers should not be used to turn the block as they provide 
	insufficient control. 
</p>

<h4>Drawing Designs</h4>

<p>
	The metal is first coated with China white. The finger is wet with saliva and rubbed 
	on the block of China white. This “paintbrush” is then rubbed around the metal 
	surface creating a slightly cloudy or hazy appearance. A fine pencil is then used 
	to draw the design on the metal. The pencil lead that came with the set is 0.3 mm. 
	Mike uses a 0.5 mm lead. For large designs it may be necessary to spray artist’s 
	fixative on the design. This will keep you from accidentally wiping off the design 
	during cutting.
</p>

<h4>Transferring Artwork</h4>

<p>
	Transfers can be purchased from a variety of sources including Mike’s transfers 
	designed for specific firearms. They can also be designed on the computer and 
	printed out with an inkjet printer. The design must be printed in reverse on 
	overhead printer transparency. Printing must be done on the mucilage side. Transfer 
	fluid (such as Transfer Magic) can be made from Damar varnish, available in art 
	stores, diluted with isopropanol (9:1 isopropanol:varnish). The transfer fluid is 
	painted on the metal with a Q-tip and allowed to dry for a few minutes. The transfer 
	paper is laid on, ink side down and burnished with a burnishing tool. The paper is 
	removed leaving a fairly resistant design on the metal ready for engraving. There is 
	some variation with different inkjet composition. When cutting is complete remove 
	the varnish with denatured alcohol.
</p>

<p>
	Engraving patterns can also be transferred from a completed engraving to a new one 
	or from one part of an engraving to another. The following is a recipe based on 
	Mike’s experience that is consistently successful. Scott Magic Matte Tape 
	(preferentially 1” wide) and Chapstick (classic original) are the key items that 
	have been shown superior to substitutes. First the wax is rubbed into the engravings 
	so as to fill the cuts. On brass the wax should be rubbed vigorously. This darkens 
	the wax and provides a much clearer and dark transferred design. The backside of a 
	piece of tape, the slick side, is rubbed over the design to remove excess wax 
	outside the cuts. Then a piece of tape with one end folded over is laid onto the 
	image to completely cover it and picked up. One end of the tape is laid sticky side 
	up on the bench and a small piece of tape is used to hold down the unfolded end. 
	The taped end keeps the tape from moving during transfer to the next piece of tape. 
	Another piece of tape is laid on the new surface to be cut, removed and discarded 
	cleaning the surface. The image is now on one piece of tape, but needs to be 
	inverted. A new piece of tape with one end folded is gently laid on the image 
	sticky side down. After carefully grasping the folded ends the two pieces of tape 
	can be separated. The reversed image containing tape is then laid on the cleaned 
	metal surface sticky side down. Use a small piece of tape to hold one end down to 
	the metal surface. Rub the top of the piece of tape with the image briskly, but 
	lightly all over. Gently lift the tape to check the image (thus the value of taping 
	one end down). Remove the reversed image by grasping and pulling the folded end. 
	This reversed image can often be used 2 or 3 times.
</p>

<h4>Lettering</h4>

<p>
	Use professionally designed fonts. Always remember that everyone can recognize bad 
	lettering. The most important part of lettering is ensuring the spelling is correct. 
	Always double check spelling! A nice font to use is Edwardian, a script font. Draw 
	lines to define the top and the bottom of the capital letters. Lower case letters 
	should be about 2/3 as tall as capitals for block letters and slightly smaller for 
	script. The correct angle for script letters is 52.5&deg;. This angle can easily be 
	found by drawing a square, dividing the top edge into fourths and drawing a line 
	from the 3/4 mark on top to the bottom left corner as pictured below. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Font angle.jpg" alt="Font angle" width="592" height="266">

<p>
	Use a wide flat for letter verticals and a narrower flat for horizontals in block 
	lettering. Block letters can also be cut wth a wriggle cut.
</p>

<h4>Scrolls</h4>

<p>
	Scrolls were used by the Greeks to decorate their weapons. The scroll form is based 
	on the nautilus shell, where the scroll can be seen complete by cutting the shell 
	in half. (Mathematicians call this the logarithmic spiral.) A diagram of this scroll 
	is depicted below. The backbone of the scroll needs to be large enough to accommodate 
	the detail inside. Just inside the backbone you can clearly see a visual open space 
	that is left empty. Nothing touches the scroll from the inside! The goal is a 
	balanced scroll pattern with leaf structure and negative space. The negative space 
	should be 1/3 of the total or less so as to not overpower the scroll work.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Scroll.jpg" alt="Scroll" width="824" height="824">

<p>
	Pictured is a set of steps for forming an English scroll (from Mike after the class).
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/English scrolls.jpg" alt="English scroll instructions" width="5100" height="6600">

<h4>Dot Punching</h4>

<p>
	This is one of the three important techniques to master along with scroll work and 
	border design, followed by quality of the detail and composition. Every dot is an 
	individual. This means that no dot should invade another dot’s space. Open space 
	between dots should be minimized. The dots should be tangential to one another, but 
	open space is better than overlapped. The punch is held vertically in a sleeve 
	between the thumb and two fingers, placed against the work and tapped twice, once 
	to set the punch and a little more forcefully a second time to make the dot (or 
	circle). Common punch sizes for firearms are 4, 5, and 6. Different sizes should 
	should not be mixed. The punched area presents a darker surface relative to the 
	brighter cuts from gravers. Consequently, dot punching is used to elevate the 
	brightness of the scroll work. Silicone fuel lines make the best sleeves for dot 
	punches. The dot punch can also be used tilted for half-moon detailing.
</p>

</p>
	Dot punches also known as beading tools are can be used for setting stones. Once a 
	stone has been set into a hollow in the metal, a chip is created near the edge of 
	the stone. The bending tool is then hammered down on this chip creating a bead that 
	overlaps the edge of the stone and along with other beads holds the stone in place.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Beading.jpg" alt="Beading diagram" width="592" height="400">

<h4>Wedge Shape</h4>

<p>
	This narrow pie shape cut is made by entering the work surface and continuing at the 
	same angle to the end of the cut. Thus the cut deepens and widens as the cut 
	progresses producing a wedge. This can be used for instance as a number of wedges 
	all emanating from the same point to create a flower-like shape.
</p>

<h4>Cleaning</h4>

<p>
	The block needs to be cleaned regularly. Remove the set screw and pull out the 
	spring and brass plunger. The jaws cannot be reversed so label them prior to 
	removal. The jaws can then be removed as well as the long screw holding them. A 
	bearing lies flat under the vise jaws and can be lifted off. Grit collects on this 
	bearing surface (raceway). Wipe off and grease this raceway, the face of the 
	internal bearing, the top bearing race, and the shaft. Wipe off the brass plunger 
	(pin). The T-slot should be cleaned with a brush. The jaws and especially the holes 
	in the jaws as well as the screw should also be cleaned. Do not lube the screw as 
	that will collect chips. Just use a drop of oil on the screw carriage in the middle 
	of the block. Replace the jaws so they both start on the screw at the same time, 
	otherwise they will not close in the center of the vise. The pin goes back in with 
	the slant pointing up to engage with the slanted surface on the shaft. The block 
	should be cleaned at least every 6 months.
</p>

<p>
	The air powered hand tools also need to be cleaned. No oil should ever be used on 
	these tools! Use denatured alcohol to clean them. Get rid of any excess alcohol. 
	Run a Q-tip (damp with alcohol) through the barrel. Clean the piston (& spring if 
	present) and reassemble. Make certain the piston is not put back in backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Diamond hones can be cleaned with “PB Nut Blaster”. Be sure to get the spray cans 
	that say “The Original Nut and Bolt Buster”.
