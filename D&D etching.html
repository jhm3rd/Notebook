<p class=first>
	After seeing the results of engraving numbers small enough for the D&D dice, the 
	decision was made to once again try etching brass. The first step is laying out all 
	of the desired numbers and printing them on the blue transfer sheets. The same four 
	fonts are still in the running.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE possible fonts.png" alt="Four potential fonts for etching the numbers on the dice." width="1461" height="1782">

<p>
	Graphic.app will be used to draw the numbers white on a black background. Each 
	number will be framed by the appropriately sized regular polygon. For completeness 
	the side lengths of the different polygons are listed in the table below. 
</p>

<table>
	<tr><th>Die</th><th>Numbers</th><th>Polygon</th><th>Side Length</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Cube</td><td>1-6</td><td>Square</td><td>5/8"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Tetrahedron</td><td>1-4</td><td>Triangle</td><td>3/4"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Dodecahedron</td><td>1-12</td><td>Pentagon</td><td>5/16"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Icosahedron</td><td>1-20</td><td>Triangle</td><td>1/2"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Octahedron</td><td>1-8</td><td>Triangle</td><td>3/4"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Pent Trap</td><td>0-9 & 00-90</td><td>Trapezoid</td><td>9/16" & 9/32"</td></tr>
</table>
<br/>

<p class="note">
	Don't forget to underscore the 6's and 9's! Or use a dot. Also the tetrahedron has 
	all four numbers on each side as the vertex is what is rolled.
</p>

<p>
	With a few hiccups all of the dice faces were made in black and the numbers were put 
	in place. Zapfino was the chosen font. The page of dice faces was printed and did 
	not look nearly as nice as the screen. The letters' lines were too thin and did not 
	show up well. No bold version is available. A different font was selected, Charm, 
	which looks good on screen. It does have a bold version if needed.
</p>

<p>
	The numerals were switched to the Charm font. Font sizes also had to be modified 
	for each of the dice faces. The final result can be seen in the .png exported from 
	Graphic. As can be seen in the picture below, I was unable to find a way to fill the 
	trapezoid. I ended up using the skew tool on a square and approximating the line 
	locations and lengths. As long as I can get reasonable transfer around the numbers 
	all should be good. Now it is off to the printer, OfficeMax.
</p>

<p>
	With the numbers in hand ironing comes next. A scrap of old PNP with some text from 
	the orrery was used for two trial runs. A 1" square piece of 1/16" brass sheet was 
	sanded to 600 grit and rinsed with acetone. A square of the PNP was applied and held 
	in place with clear tape. The iron was set to wool (between the O's). The hot iron 
	was held on the part, supported on a scrap of wood, with slow movement of the iron 
	for one minute. It was clear that some of the tape melted and when removed the 
	transfer was not good. A second trial was made on the other side of the piece of 
	brass, prepared as above. This time masking tape (Scotch brand) was used. Care was 
	taken to ensure the PNP was not bubbled anywhere. Again the hot iron was applied for 
	one minute. The photo below shows the very nice transfer.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE test transfer.heic" alt="The result of the trial run transferring text to a piece of brass." width="1011" height="1105">

<p>
	Time for the real thing. The cube was chosen as it is easiest to hold in the vise. 
	It was rinsed with acetone and the number one in a square of PNP was cut and taped 
	on one face. The cube held in aluminum soft jaws in the vise was heated with the 
	iron for 1 minute with no discernable transfer. Two minutes of heating also gave no 
	transfer. The aluminum soft jaws were replaced with wood soft jaws and the block 
	was heated for five minutes giving a nice transfer as seen in the photo below. Hmmm, 
	what is wrong with this picture? I forgot to flip the numbers backwards!!!!!
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE first transfer.heic" alt="The result of the first transfer to the cubic die." width="979" height="1035">

<p>
	The numbers were all flipped around the vertical axis and are now backwards in the 
	printout. Back to Office Depot with the last two sheets of blue PNP film. With the 
	new printouts in hand it was back to the iron. The previous ink was removed with 
	acetone on a paper towel. The new printout was taped on with one layer of masking 
	tape and heated for five minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Numbers 1 & 6 went well, but for some reason 2 did not transfer on one side of the 
	face. It was redone and still has some poor transfer seen in the photo below. This 
	can be touched up before etching. A further worry is the tape. It can easily peel 
	off some of the transferred ink. The same thing happened with the wooden vise jaws 
	where some ink was transferred from the 6 face to the vise jaw. Another factor to 
	take into account is the time needed for each face. These faces are taking about 15 
	minutes each.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE hex one transfer.heic" alt="The result of the transfer of the 1 to the cubic die." width="1004" height="1071">
<img class=inline src="images/DDDE hex two transfer.heic" alt="The result of the transfer of the 2 to the cubic die." width="1192" height="1285">

<p>
	A slightly different approach is to set the die on a piece of wood, maybe with a 
	piece of the PNP scrap plastic between the die and the wood, and then heat the die 
	with the iron. After finishing the first side the die is turned, a new face has the 
	number taped on and it is heated briefly, a minute or so. This is repeated all 
	while the die remains relatively hot. The tape will need to be cut to fit a face and 
	the PNP with number will need to be cut smaller than the face. A pair of grippers 
	will need to be prepared with plastic gripping surfaces to turn the hot die. Another 
	alternative is purchasing a hot plate. Went for the full enchilada purchasing a hot 
	plate, silicone coated grippers and small non-steam iron along with more PNP transfer 
	film. The film is purchased from <a href="https://techniks.com/">Teckniks</a>. Work 
	is temporary on hold until the purchases arrive. Happy Mar10 day!
</p>

<p>
	The newest plan is to warm the die on the hot plate. The die will not sit directly on 
	the hot plate, but on scrap plastic transfer film without the ink. The number will 
	be stuck to masking tape cut to just overlap the number and stick only to the top 
	die face. This face will be heated with the iron for a less than five minutes as the 
	die will already be hot. The tape and film will be removed and the die flipped to 
	the next face to repeat the process. Any bad takes will be wiped off after the die 
	cools, the die will be reheated and the cleaned faces renumbered.
</p>

<p>
	The presents arrived last evening, a hot plate, baby iron and silicone grippers. The 
	photo below shows the iron and hot plate. Time to enact the above plan, heating a die 
	between cast iron and ceramic!
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE transfer tools.heic" alt="The new tools for transferring designs from PNP film to brass." width="2438" height="3136">

<p>
	A small experiment was conducted with the hot plate, 1/4" of water was heated on 
	setting #1, bringing the water to barely boiling in 3-4 minutes. The light that 
	indicates the heating element is on, shut off just as water began to bubble. I am 
	calling this simmer or about 200&deg; F. We will begin this process with the hot 
	plate set to setting #1. Three faces of the cubic die remain unnumbered, though the 
	1 & 6 need to be redone, so five faces were wiped with acetone to remove ink and 
	glue. The corresponding numbers for these faces were prepared on tape in advance.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE heating die.heic" alt="The cubic die warming up on the aluminum intermediary plate." width="1801" height="1504">

<p>
	Hmmm! Not so good, but maybe the process can be salvaged. the first problem was the 
	plastic film melted onto the hot plate. the surface must be significantly hotter 
	than expected. After cleaning most of the goop off an aluminum plate was used to 
	distribute the heat and protect the hot plate. The cube after five minutes was hot, 
	probably too hot as #6 slipped during ironing. In fact the iron was used more to 
	press the succeeding numbers onto the cube and not really for heating. The last two 
	numbers got the iron for only ten seconds or so. The cube was left to cool on the 
	table saw's surface. The photos below show the results. The 6 smeared as the iron 
	was left on too long, The other numbers are not too bad. The 2 was grabbed by the 
	grippers on numerous occasions while hot, leaving marks. Notice the 3 is upside 
	down!
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE second sides.heic" alt="The other three sides of the first die using new transfer process." width="1069" height="1071">

<p>
	I may have figured it out, a tapeless approach. The hot plate is set on the dot 
	before #1. The film is cut with a holding strip of blue film on one side of the 
	number. The die is heated up and the number applied with needle nose pliers, making 
	sure it sticks immediately. The iron is held on the film for 60 seconds. The die is 
	turned for the next number. This worked well on the second half of the octahedron, 
	where only the number 4 slipped, but 2, 6, & 8 were good transfers. Repeated the 
	other four, only two of them worked well. Hopefully, my success rate with improve 
	with practice.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE three good.heic" alt="The three sides of the die using that worked well." width="1215" height="1156">

<p>
	Moving forward, even though more copies of the PNP are needed. The PT is the next 
	target, the one with the numbers 0-9. The even numbers, including 0 were cut out 
	first. Their order of pressing in place is dictated by the die provided by Levi. 
	Impossible on these small faces!! I can't hold the iron on the PNP sitting on the 
	die without it slipping and moving the PNP! Tape does not work. I am running out of 
	options.
</p>

<p>
	Stamping does not produce great looking letters or numbers, but may be my only choice 
	at this point. I pulled out my stamps and tried it out on the scrap octahedron. The 
	numbers are too small for this size die face, but other than that, not too bad. The 
	letters were filled with black fingernail polish and the excess scraped off. A little 
	clean-up with acetone produced the numbered die shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE stamp test.heic" alt="A scrap octahedron was stamped with my metal stanps and painted with fingernail polish." width="1208" height="1271">

<p>
	The least expensive stamps I could find were on Etsy. A 1/4" set of number stamps is 
	$14 and a 3/8" number set is $24. Both were ordered this morning. MSC had number 
	sets starting at $40, while McMaster-Carr had full sets starting at over $100. 
	Unfortunately, the stamps won't show up for at least two weeks, though shipping is 
	free.
</p>

<p>
	The stamps showed up the last day of March, so now it is time to complete the dice. 
	The first task was recutting the stamping jig. The jig was not the same on both ends. 
	It was chucked in the mill vise and one side of the vee groove was set vertical with 
	the rule. The vee groove was recut with a 3/16" end mill producing a square corner 
	and a groove that was square to the base. The jig is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE stamp jig.heic" alt="A jig for stamping square to the face stamped." width="975" height="1111">

<p>
	The first die numbered was the cubic die as it is the simplest, especially with 
	respect to holding the part with one face level on top. The numbers were punched and 
	the die was sanded lightly on all sides with 1000 grit paper. The edges and corners 
	were sanded similarly. The first two photos below show the hexahedron and octahedron 
	at this stage.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE hex-oct stamped.heic" alt="The hexahedron and octahedron dice after stamping and sanding." width="1078" height="1246">

<p>
	Black fingernail polish was painted on the numbers, scraped off with a plastic 
	scraper and then cleaned up with a rag dipped in acetone. The numbers are somewhat 
	disappointing after all this work as seen in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE hex-oct painted.heic" alt="The hexahedron and octahedron dice after painting the numbers." width="1238" height="1244">

<p>
	A test run was conducted on some previous stamping practice. The stamped numbers were 
	painted with fingernail polish and scraped. After drying Protecta-Clear was painted 
	onto the brass. The fingernail polish did not run!! The plan for varnishing these 
	two dice is to do all but one face with two coats and then do the last face after the 
	previously painted faces have dried, 45 minutes or so.
</p>

<p>
	The varnishing was completed, two coats, on the first two dice. The dodecagon was 
	numbered next using the middle size stamps, 1/4", just purchased. This die requires 
	two digit numbers, which were done without any special alignment. The completely 
	stamped die is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE dodec stamped.heic" alt="The numbers stamped on the dodecahedron die." width="1062" height="934">

<p>
	The process was repeated for the icosahedron. Both dice were then sanded on edges 
	and corners with 600 grit sandpaper. The faces were sanded with 1000 grit sandpaper. 
	The dice were washed with soap and water followed by an acetone rinse. The numbers 
	were blackened and the varnish was painted on.
</p>

<p>
	Second thoughts! I really don't like the look of the punched numbers. Even the well-
	done numbers are boring and rather ugly. Unfortunately, there are many numbers that 
	are also ugly due to poor implementation, incorrectly placed, poorly struck, etc. 
	After browsing all of Google's fonts, one was selected that was unique and looked 
	to be doable with my minimal engraving skill, 
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caesar+Dressing">Caesar Dressing</a>. Time 
	for some engraving practice.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE caesar dressing.png" alt="A possible font for engraving." width="504" height="124">

<p>
	The numbers were printed out at multiple sizes. A few numbers were transferred to a 
	scrap of brass using China white and carbon paper. The numbers were then fairly 
	easily engraved. After engraving the brass was washed and then the numbers were 
	blackened with the fingernail polish. The three photos below show the progression of 
	events, from engraved to blackened. (Don't understand why the brass came out looking 
	brown in the last two photos.) A quick sanding on 1000 grit sandpaper did a good 
	job cleaning up the brass as seen in the fourth image. I think we've got a winner!
</p>

<p>
	The two pentagonal trapezohedrons were the guinea pigs for engraving Caesar dressing 
	numerals. The die was held between two small pieces of wood in the engraver's vise. 
	The vise had to be cranked tight to keep the die from twisting during engraving. The 
	face was smeared with China white and the numeral transferred to the face using carbon 
	paper and numerals on translucent transfer paper. The latter allowed careful alignment 
	of the numeral. The numerals were then readily engraved as they are all made of short 
	line segments. The first picture below shows the first engraving, the number 0. After 
	engraving all ten numerals the die was washed. The second picture below shows both of 
	the completed pentagonal trapezohedrons.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE PTs engraved.heic" alt="Both pentagonal trapezohedrons after engraving." width="1269" height="1108">

<p>
	I am leaning against using the fingernail polish to blacken the numerals. I prefer 
	the bright numeral against a matte finish, so the dice will be sanded with 1000 grit 
	sandpaper. The already finished dice were covered in acetone to remove the varnish 
	and the fingernail polish. While waiting for this to happen, the two PT dice were 
	sanded with 1000 grit sandpaper. The edges and corners were sanded with 600 grit 
	sandpaper. These two dice are seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE PTs sanded.heic" alt="Both pentagonal trapezohedrons after engraving and sanding." width="1409" height="1133">

<p>
	An hour plus of sanding and the four dice had their numerals removed. My hands are 
	shot. Two hours later I completed the sanding with 220, 320, 400, and 600 grit 
	sandpaper, quite a bit easier than removing the numerals, though still a long process 
	with forty-six faces to sand.
</p>

<p>
	Engraving began with the hexahedron after an afternoon off to view the solar eclipse, 
	seen in the photo below (notice the star to the lower right of the sun! Unfortunately, 
	the photo does not capture the annular ring very clearly.) This die could be held 
	directly in the engraver's vise jaws. The octahedron done next could not be held in 
	the vise and was held to a block of wood with double sided tape. The photo below 
	shows the two engraved dice still covered in China white.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE h&e engraved.heic" alt="Hexahedron and octahedron after engraving the second time." width="1124" height="991">

<p>
	The dodecahedron was difficult to hold tightly enough in the vise so it didn't turn 
	during engraving, but perseverance paid off and the die was completed. The next 
	morning the icosahedron was tackled. Lots of care was taken to get the correct 
	numerals on each face in the appropriate orientation. Two hours later the die was 
	fully engraved. The photo below shows the 12- and 20-sided dice. Only the tetrahedron 
	remains.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/DDDE d&i engraved.heic" alt="Dodecahedron and icosaahedron after engraving the second time." width="1233" height="1056">

<p>
	The next to the last task was then tackled, sanding. All of the edges and corners 
	for the tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron (edges 
	only) were sanded with 600 grit sandpaper. The engraved faces were sanded with 1000 
	grit sandpaper. All five dice were washed with soap and water and then cleaned with 
	acetone. After drying, all seven of the dice were painted with Protecta-Clear varnish, 
	two coats. The first photo below shows the dice just before painting.

<p>
	The second set of dice faces were painted this morning. Levi will be over tomorrow 
	evening, so hope to give him the dice then. The first photo below shows the painting 
	setup. The second shows the completed set of seven dice.
