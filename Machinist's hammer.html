<p class=first>
	A machinist's hammer with two different soft heads would be nice to have and seems 
	like a nice tool to make during the Covid-19 isolation. The hammer will be made with 
	at least two soft replaceable faces. Initially, there will be a brass face and a 
	delrin (acetal) face (maybe aluminum in the future). I have a few lengths of 
	1&nbsp;3/8" hex aluminum that will be used for the head and the handle. The center 
	part of the head will be left at 1&nbsp;3/8" since it already has a flat face for 
	handle attachment. Both the head and the handle will need to be made using the South 
	Bend lathe. The three jaw chuck on the Sherline will only hold about 1&nbsp;1/8" of the 
	stock with the jaws reversed.
</p>

<p>
	The faces will be 1" in diameter and 3/4" long. The head will be 2&nbsp;1/4" long. 
	Narrow necks will join the 3/8" X 1" face plates to the unaltered hex serving as 
	the center of the head. A rough sketch of the planned head is shown below. The neck 
	will be roughed out with a cutoff tool and then filed to final shape.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Hammer head sketch.jpg" alt="Hammer head sketch" width="574" height="364">

<p class="note">
	Hopefully, the isolation will conclude prior to my planned MASW CAD course. If so, 
	this will be one of the last of the iSketch drawings.
</p>

<p>
	A 5" length of the 1&nbsp;3/8" aluminum hex was cut with a hacksaw to provide a 3" 
	length of the hex stock. This was chucked in the South Bend lathe leaving a 
	little more than 2&nbsp;1/4" out. The aluminum was faced and center drilled for a 
	live tailstock center. The first 0.5" was reduced to 1.00" diameter. The parting 
	tool was used to provide steps forming the neck behind the face. This was then 
	filed with a round file and a half round file to produce the desired profile. It 
	was also sanded to 1000 grit. Work was started on the chuck end. A 1/2" length 
	starting 1&nbsp;3/4" from the free end was reduced to 1&nbsp;1/8". Work was stopped 
	at this point due to the 50&deg; temperature in the garage.
</p>

<p>
	The face constructed above was drilled with a #7 drill and tapped 1/4-20. The part 
	was removed and reversed in the chuck. The diameter was reduced to 1.00" and then the 
	part was faced so about 3/4" of 1" stock remained. A .25" deep cut was made with 
	the parting tool about 5/16" from the end. Two different tools were used to make 
	the neck. Since, the filing above took about 1 hour a different approach was needed. 
	This approach still needed filing, but significantly less. The two ends are quite 
	different as a result of the different approaches. Oh well, a unique hammer! The end 
	was center drilled, drilled with the #7 drill, and tapped 1/4-20. The next hour was 
	spent cleaning up the aluminum chips.
</p>

<p>
	I have decided to use the end of the handle as a place to store a third soft head, so 
	the three heads will be nylon, brass and aluminum. The handle will be 3" long with a 
	1/2" transition to a narrower 3&nbsp;1/2" long neck. The neck will terminate in a 
	1/2" length of 3/8-16 threads. A few decorative grooves and knurling will finish the 
	handle. The 3" handle is a bit short, but when the third soft head is screwed in 
	place it will be 4" long.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Hammer handle sketch.jpg" alt="Hammer handle plan" width="2499" height="630">

<p>
	Started on the handle in the 50&deg; garage this morning. A 10" length of 1&nbsp;3/8" 
	hex was placed in the three jaw chuck. It was center drilled and faced. A live 
	tailstock center was used for support. About 7&nbsp;3/4" was reduced to 1&nbsp;1/4" 
	diameter. (A hammer handle was measured and found to be 1&nbsp;1/4" X 1".) A section 
	3" to 7&nbsp;3/4" was then further reduced to 1.0". The compound slide was then used 
	to cut the angle from one diameter to the next. The compound was set at a 45&deg; 
	angle. The cross slide was advanced 0.005" and the compound slide was then advanced to 
	the smaller diameter. Once the angle met the large diameter, one final pass was 
	taken along the small diameter. The small diameter was sanded with 220- and 400-grit 
	paper.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Hammer handle in situ.jpg" alt="Hammer handle in progress" width="2597" height="1300">

<p>
	The handle was cut off at 8" with the parting tool. The tailstock center was used
	during the parting off, but the cutting was stopped with about 1/8" left. The rest 
	was cut with a hacksaw. The handle was then turned around in the chuck and soft jaws 
	were used to hold the large diameter end. The small diameter end was faced and 
	center drilled. 1/2" of this end were reduced to 3/8" while using a tailstock center. 
	The parting tool was used to put a groove for thread relief. A 3/8-24 die was used to 
	thread the reduced end while the handle was held in the vise. The threaded hole for 
	storing the third face will be cut after knurling the handle.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Hammer handle.jpg" alt="Hammer handle before knurling" width="2128" height="1165">

<p>
	The knurling tool cannot be mounted on the South Bend lathe so the work was moved to 
	the basement. At this point I realized that the knurling tool will not work on the 
	handle. It does not open sufficiently to span the 1&nbsp;1/4" diameter! Consequently, 
	a knurling tool for the South Bend has been ordered from Victor Machinery. They were 
	the first retail outlet that had an inexpensive knurl holder that would fit the 
	lathe's lantern post.
</p>

<p>
	Spent the morning writing a program to <a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Tools/Round%20groove%20cutting.html">calculate the lathe cuts</a> 
	needed for a round groove in the side of a shaft. A second length of 1&nbsp;3/8" X 3" 
	hex stock was chucked in the South Bend and the end faced 3/4" was reduced to 1" 
	diameter. A Sharpie mark was made at 1/2" and the 1/16" parting tool was centered on 
	this mark. According to the calculations it was advanced into the shaft 0.118". A 
	series of 18 cuts was then made moving the compound slide to the right (0.010" 
	initially and 0.005" later.) Each cut was shallower than the last. This series 
	of 18 cuts was repeated moving the compound to the left. This produced the rough 
	semi-circular groove seen in the following picture.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Rough groove.jpg" alt="Rough groove in hammer head" width="1503" height="1965">

<p>
	The picture shows a very rough surface, but a few strokes with a 1/4" round file and 
	it was a very nice groove. An additional 1/8" of shaft was reduced to about 1&nbsp;3/16". 
	The left side of the groove was filed (about 200 strokes with a half round file). 
	Sanding up to 1500 grit produced the following finish. On the other side I may use 
	cuts for a 1/8" radius groove on the right and a 1/4" radius groove on the left. 
	This should eliminate most of the filing and probably produce a better result. Before 
	removing the work from the chuck the end was center drilled and then drilled 1/2" 
	deep with a #7 drill. After removing the hole was tapped 1/4-20.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Filed groove.jpg" alt="Filed groove in hammer head" width="1501" height="1881">

<p>
	The hammer head was reversed in the chuck and the end was faced. The first 3/4" was 
	reduced to 1.00". The part was pulled out of the chuck so enough material protruded 
	giving the parting tool in the compound set at 90&deg; sufficient room. The first cut 
	was made 1/2" from the end of the part to a depth of 0.118". This was followed with 
	the series of cuts to the right making a 1/8" radius. The parting tool was returned to 
	the first cut and a series of cuts was made to the left. In this case the compound 
	was adjusted 0.02" and 0.01" instead of the prescribed 0.01" and 0.005", respectively. 
	This led to a wider semi-circular cut. The hex was reduced by about 3/16" for 1/8". 
	Filing gave a decent groove and was followed by sanding to 1500 grit. 
</p>

<p>
	The hammer head was then held in a vise on the large drill press. It was very 
	difficult to get any drill to penetrate the aluminum! I guess this is because the 
	speed is too high. When attempting to use a small center drill the tip broke off in 
	the work. I was unable to remove the stub so the part now has a new feature, a round 
	depression on the face opposite the handle. The head was easily drilled on the small
	drill press with significantly lower speed. It was drilled up to an "O" drill 1/2" 
	deep centered on one face and then tapped 3/8-24. It was sanded on all of the hex 
	faces 150 to 1500 grit.
</p>

<p>
	When the handle was installed it looked too big relative to the hex face of the head. 
	It was put back in the lathe using soft jaws and a tailstock center. The narrow end 
	was reduced to 0.86" diameter and this end was again sanded up to 1500 grit. The 
	assembled hammer is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Hammer & head.jpg" alt="Hammer and head fitted" width="2657" height="2413">

<p>
	Worked on the faces with some success today even though the garage was quite cold. 
	The brass face was cut first. A 5" length of brass was held in the three jaw with 
	about 2" exposed. It was faced and then 1&nbsp;1/2" was reduced to 1.00". The first 
	3/8" was further reduced to 0.25". The brass was parted off at 1&nbsp;3/8". It was 
	flipped in the chuck and the new end faced. The stub was threaded with a 1/4-20 die 
	in the bench vise. I must have bent the stub somehow as it does not seat flush with 
	the head. The aluminum face was made from the first head in a fashion similar to 
	the brass. This stub was also threaded and is not bent! Finally the nylon was cut 
	from 1" stock received. It had some text printed on the side so about 0.005" was 
	removed to erase this text. I was unable to thread the nylon stub. The die just 
	ground away the end and never cut threads. So the stub was removed and the nylon 
	was drilled with a #7 drill and tapped 1/4-20. A length of brass was threaded for 
	about 5/8" and cut off. The threaded rod was glued into the face with Loctite. This 
	may be the approach used to salvage the brass face. The three faces at this stage 
	are pictured below.
</p>

<p class="note">
	I noticed after multiple uses that the parting tool when used with the 3/8" cutter 
	shim is significantly below center height!! This may be part of the reason for the 
	challenges encountered during its use. I attempted to remedy this by placing a drill 
	under the tool to add the needed extra shimming, but this was less than satisfactory. 
	I will need to make a shim specifically for it.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Faces semi-complete.jpg" alt="Faces as currently completed" width="1883" height="1426">

<p>
	The brass face was returned to the lathe after sawing off the threaded stub. The end 
	was faced and a 1/4" hole was drilled 1/2" deep. The aluminum face went through the 
	same process. Both faces were then placed in the vise and tapped 1/4-20. A 1/4" brass 
	rod was put in the Sherline lathe and the 1/4-20 die was started after chamfering the 
	end. The rod was then moved to the vise and threading continued for 1&nbsp;1/4". Two 
	nuts were put on the threaded end and 5/8" of thread was cut off with a saw. The nut 
	on the cut off portion was removed over the cut end to clean up the threads. A second 
	5/8" length of thread was cut off and again a nut was used to clean up the cut 
	threads. An end of the second threaded stub was chamfered. One threaded rod was 
	screwed into the brass face and one into the aluminum face with the chamfered ends 
	out. Both got a drop of Loctite on the threads prior to installing. After drying 
	overnight the brass and nylon faces were screwed onto the hammer head. Only drilling 
	and threading the end along with knurling the handle remain.

<p>
	Knurled this afternoon on the South Bend lathe with the new knurling tool holder, I 
	received yesterday. It was quite the comedy of errors. I decided to use the autofeed 
	capability of the lathe. I loosened a screw at the end and engaged the gears turning 
	the feed screw. After about ten minutes I was able to get the change gears engaged 
	at an appropriate speed. It was fairly straightforward to engage the feed and to 
	disengage it. That is until the handle popped off and a ball bearing rolled away. I 
	was able to continue just by holding the handle in place. The handle was held in 
	soft jaws and a tailstock live center was used for support. The new knurling tool 
	holder was at the correct height when using the original washer for the lantern tool 
	post. It took multiple passes with the knurling wheels before a deep enough knurl 
	was formed. The compound had to be advanced (it was set at 91&deg;) quite a bit 
	farther (.050") than I expected. I guess that is to make up for all of the flex in 
	the system. The ends of the knurl were then cleaned up by reducing the diameter by 
	about 0.03". 
</p>

<p class="note">
	The ball bearing was found, but the spring was not. The ball bearing was dropped in 
	a hole in the handle opening so it won't get lost. I will need to go back to the 
	South Bend rebuild to determine what type of spring to purchase.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, the end of the handle was drilled with a #7 drill and tapped 1/4-20. The 
	hole was drilled 1/2" like the rest of the holes for faces, but the aluminum face 
	did not go in all the way. I put the aluminum face in the Sherline lathe with soft 
	jaws and faced the end removing about 0.12". The threads were cleaned up with the 
	die and the face was installed in the end of the hammer.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Machinists hammer complete.jpg" alt="Hammer completed" width="2644" height="3071">

<p class="note">
	I am still considering reducing the diameter of the handle neck. Either a taper or 
	just a smaller diameter. It just seems kind of big and clunky as it joins the head. 
	Other than that it looks pretty nice.
</p>

<p>
	Decided to reduce the diameter of the shaft this morning. I attempted to use the 
	taper attachment. I figured a 1.5&deg; offset would give me a 3/32" smaller diameter 
	at the head end with the taper extending the full 3.5" of the shaft. For some reason 
	I could not get the cutter to follow the taper. Carriage movement was very tight.
	So I changed to just making a smaller diameter. I reduced the diameter to about 5/8". 
	I then sanded up to 1500 grit. Finally, the taper from the knurled part to the new 
	diameter was cleaned up using the compound slide. A final picture is included below.
