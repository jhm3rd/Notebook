<p class=first>
	Stuart de Haro had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmBj3kEoX4E">short 
	video</a> on how to make roses from thin stock sheet metal. I printed out the pdf 
	plans and purchased some brass, aluminum and tin coated steel from Ace Hardware. 
	The thickness of the sheets vary (brass & aluminum are 0.016", steel is 0.008"), so 
	it will be interesting how this affects shaping them.
</p>

<p>
	The video suggested just placing the printout on the metal and wiping with acetone. 
	Supposedly the ink would transfer to the metal. I saw no transfer whatsoever. The 
	plans were cut out. The metal was sprayed with the 3M 77 adhesive. The paper was 
	applied to the metal. The holes were then drilled with the sheet stock held between 
	two pieces of wood in the vise.
</p>

<img class=inline src="valRoses/VR drilling.jpg" alt="Drilling the holes for the stem" width="1677" height="1746">

<p>
	After drilling the petals and leaves were cut from the sheet. They were cut out with 
	tin snips. The brass was especially difficult as it required more force to cut. My 
	hand was left all cramped up. A glove was worn on the hand holding the part to 
	minimize fingerprints on the metal.
</p>

<p>
	Deburring is next. The holes need some major burr removal, while the edges need to 
	be rounded over. Since I don't have a Scotch Brite deburring wheel, I will use the 
	Dremel in its vise holder with some type of deburring wheel or sanding cylinder. A 
	tiny Scotch Brite wheel was used. In fact two were used up. It did not do a very 
	good job in the holes in the tin coated steel. These were significantly rougher 
	than the others.
</p>

<p>
	The veins were put in the petals and in the small leaves. A cold chisel was used 
	along with a ball peen hammer to add some dents. Two petals of each metal had extra 
	dents added. These will be the outer petals. The photos show the dents in the tin 
	coated steel and the completed 'denting'.
</p>

<p>
	The paper was peeled off of the back. It came off easily especially if it was still 
	wet with acetone and had soaked for five to ten minutes. Removing the paper left a 
	lot of glue as seen in the first photo below. Luckily, the glue could be rubbed off 
	with a rubber glove. The second photo shows all of the cleaned parts. At this time 
	any burrs from the cutting were removed and the holes were cleaned up as needed. The 
	ends of the petals were also slightly bent with a pair of needle nose pliers.
</p>

<p>
	I decided to pair the brass petals with the aluminum leaves and the steel stem. A 10" 
	length of 1/4" drill rod was cut. It was faced on both ends and one end was reduced 
	to 0.185" for 0.250". (Too long!) The center part of the petals was flattened with a 
	ball peen and they were placed on the stem after the leaves. They were arranged in 
	alternating positions around the circle. The end of the shaft was peened to hold the 
	petals in place. This was quite the challenge for the steel shaft, but was eventually 
	completed when the big peen was retrieved from the garage. The photo shows the 
	successful peening.
</p>

<p>
	The petals were then individually shaped and bent vertically. The inner petals were 
	rounded the most. The bottom stayed fairly square, but it is not too noticeable. The 
	leaves were bent down slightly. The brass rose is shown below.
</p>

<p>
	This process was repeated. The tin plated steel petals were paired with the brass 
	leaves and the aluminum stem. The aluminum petals were accompanied by the steel 
	leaves and the brass stem. After these two roses were completed all three stems were 
	artfully bent. The next two photos show the completed roses in the vise vase. I have 
	not decided whether I will paint a clear varnish on the roses to prevent 
	tarnishing. I am really impressed with how they came out. Thank-you Stuart!

<p>
	Decided in favor of varnishing. This morning a coat of Protect-a-Clear was put on 
	the inside and outside of the rose petals and on the leaves. The roses were 
	thoroughly enjoyed by Rhea on Valentineâ€™s day morning.
