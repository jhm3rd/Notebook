<p class=first>
	Rhea agreed that yo-yo's would make nice presents for the grandsons on Hanukkah. An 
	article from Home Shop Machinist vol. 38, no. 4, pg 60 was the inspiration and will 
	be followed to make the yo-yo's. They are made from aluminum, a simple turning 
	project, and have a buried ball bearing enabling easier "sleep" mode.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY fm mag.jpg" alt="A shot of the yo-yo photo in the magazine." width="875" height="1300">

<p>
	Four aluminum blanks are needed to begin the project. After checking SpeedyMetals 
	and finding a foot of 2&nbsp;1/4" round 6061 aluminum cost over $60 plus $20 
	shipping, I looked elsewhere. Metal Supermarkets has a facility on W. 79th St. I 
	called the store, 317-584-8555, and a few hours later I received the quote for < $60. 
	It can be picked up early after they call. This was done and I am now the proud owner 
	of a one foot long round bar of aluminum.
</p>

<p>
	The next part of the project tackled was making the form tools. I found a 1/8"&nbsp;X3/8" 
	bar of HSS in the hoard of material Klaus Schmiegel gave me. I marked out a 1/4" radius 
	arc on each end, one for right hand and one for left hand cutting. The arcs were 
	ground with a 5&deg; relief on the grinder first with the coarse and then fine wheels.
</p>

<p>
	At this point I realized I had no way to hold this cutter in the lathe, so it is time 
	for the titular diversion. Klaus also gave me a lathe tool holder that has a slot on 
	each side for a tool. The holder does not have a tee nut or screw. It is also 
	significantly too low to hold the form tool on center. So three parts were made. The 
	first was the simplest, a 1/2" thick disk of aluminum to raise the holder, essentially 
	a thick washer the holder will sit on. The washer was drilled 13/32", a through hole 
	for the eventual 3/8-16 screw.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY form tool.HEIC" alt="The form tool laying next to the tool holder raised by the washer." width="2050" height="2294">

<p>
	The nut was made next, also from an aluminum disk. The shoulders of the nut were formed 
	with the shaper. The shaper worked well and left a nice finish after the tool was 
	reground and honed on the diamond stone. The nut was drilled to 1/2" and then 
	countersunk on the bottom side. A bronze insert was made to fit in this hole and it 
	was threaded 3/8-16 with a tap. The insert was held in place with LocTite. The round 
	edges were cut off with a hack saw and then milled to the 1&nbsp;1/4" width of the 
	compound's opening.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY tee nut.HEIC" alt="The finished tee nut with the nice finish from the shaper." width="1171" height="1271">


<p>
	The final part needed is a screw. I had no appropriate screws for use. I also didn't 
	want to use a standard screw as that would require having yet another wrench handy. 
	I found some 3/4" hex that fits the homemade wrench kept on the tailstock. A 4" 
	length of this was cut off with the bandsaw. One end was faced and heavily chamfered. 
	The tool was then held by this end in the chuck and the distal end was center drilled, 
	while supporting this end with a tailstock center, 2&nbsp;1/2" was turned down to 0.370". 
	This end was chamfered and then threaded 3/8"-16 for about 3/4". The threading went 
	easily after realizing the die I initially attempted to use is for left hand threads! 
	After some clean-up the parts were assembled on the cross slide. The screw needed the 
	threaded end shortened by about 1/4". About 3/16" was cut off with a hacksaw and the 
	end was filed to clean up the threads. A perfect fit and gives a very tightly held 
	holder with minimal force.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY holder assembly.HEIC" alt="The tool holder assembly in place on the cross slide." width="1590" height="1801">

<p>
	The tool was tried out this morning. It was placed in the tool holder and raised with 
	a 1/16" shim to get it on center. A scrap was set up in the lathe chuck. The tool 
	worked fine, though there was significant chatter or squeal as expected. The surface 
	finish has grooves indicating that the tool is not ground well. I am not sure this is 
	any easier than using a file to round the corners. The photo below shows the result.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY round.HEIC" alt="The form tool and the resulting rounded corner on a piece of scrap." width="2194" height="1960">

<p>
	The process in the article was followed for the first yo-yo side. A 9/16" thick disk 
	of aluminum was cut off with the bandsaw. This was faced on one side and drilled 
	0.30" deep with a #29 drill. It was threaded 8-32 using the recently purchased 
	bottoming tap. The hole was then countersunk with a 3/8" end mill held in the drill 
	chuck. The countersink was done slowly and frequently measured so the total depth is 
	0.020". The disk was flipped over and the opposite side faced. A boring bar was used 
	to make a 1/8" deep by 1&nbsp;3/4" recess.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY recess side.heic" alt="The side with the recess bored." width="1896" height="1722">

<p>
	The process above was repeated to complete the drilled and tapped side for the five 
	remaining blanks. The first photo shows the nice finish resulting from careful facing. 
	The finished sides on five parts are shown in the second photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY five tapped.heic" alt="Five halves with the inside faces finished." width="2786" height="1813">

<p>
	The next morning in an even colder garage the opposite sides were bored, again to 
	1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;3/4". This went well, though doing it five times became a 
	bit repetitive. The six parts at this stage are pictured below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY bored.heic" alt="The five bored sides." width="2812" height="2349">

<p>
	The final machining step is cutting the corner curves. Getting ready to utilize the 
	corner rounding tool made above and discovered the chuck jaws when closed are still 
	too large for the bored hole in the side! These corners will have to be cut on the 
	Sherline lathe. Cutting a feature like this on the small lathe with a form tool will 
	potentially overtax the machine. I will first try using the radius cutting tool. This 
	won't work as the tool is limited to 1&nbsp;1/2" diameter. A part was held in the 
	cleaned three-jaw chuck with the jaws reversed. It was first filed and then sanded to 
	give the shape seen below, significantly less than 1/4" radius. The part will need to 
	be held between pads, or between pad and tailstock center, to work both sides.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY radiused.heic" alt="A side radiused with a file and then sanded." width="1536" height="1726">

<p>
	The part was held between a pad in the chuck and the live tailstock center. It was 
	filed, and sanded up to 1500 grit. It was then polished with the buffing wheel using 
	white buffing compound. The photo shows the "yo" after washing with soap and water.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY buffed.heic" alt="A side sanded and buffed." width="1258" height="1329">

<p>
	An attempt was made to better polish the second "yo". First it was sanded with the 
	coarser crocus cloth, the corners were filed and resanded with fine crocus cloth. 
	This was polished on the buffing wheel as before. It seemed impossible to get rid of 
	the slightly cloudy polished areas at the edges of the recess. A Dremel polishing 
	wheel loaded with white rouge did the trick, but left a slightly different finish. 
	The photo below compares the two "yos", with the first on the left. The 8-32 set 
	screw did not go into either wheel until the holes were hit again with the tap. Then 
	the bearing (9mm&nbsp;X&nbsp;4mm&nbsp;X&nbsp;3mm) did not fit over the set screw!! 
	The screw will need some adjustment.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY first two.heic" alt="Comparing the first two polished wheels." width="2177" height="1508">

<p>
	Another pair were sanded and polished this morning. The sides were sanded up to 2000 
	grit using a four-jaw chuck. The edge was filed and the corners chamfered and rounded 
	with the file. The edge was sanded up to 2000 grit. The inside, the edge and the lip 
	of the recess were polished on the buffer. The center of the recess was also polished 
	with the buffer. The Dremel was used with rouge to polish the areas of the recess 
	the buffing wheel could not access. The photo below shows the finished pair of "yos".
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY second two.heic" alt="Showing the fine finish on the second two polished wheels." width="2688" height="2034">

<p>
	After reducing the diameter of a set screw by about 0.004" it fit nicely in the 
	bearing. The length also had to be reduced by about 1/8". The two yos were screwed 
	onto the set screw with the bearing trapped between. A string was wrapped around the 
	bearing (difficult to get the string wrapping started) and the yo-yo was tried out. 
	The author mentions the yo-yo is probably too heavy. I also found this to be the case 
	as it was difficult to get the yo-yo to climb back up the string. Reducing the weight 
	will take some consideration.
</p>

<p>
	The most straightforward path would be boring a groove in the inside face of each yo. 
	A groove that begins at 1/4" radius and extends 3/8" and is 1/4" deep would be about 
	the limit of removable material. A groove like this leaves about 1/8" of material in 
	the bottom of the groove before the groove on the front face. A little math indicates 
	this will remove about 15% of the volume of a yo. So the weight of a yo-yo will drop 
	from 148 g to 126 g. Is this sufficient? Most of the yo-yos on Amazon are 50-60 g, 
	but a professional version is 257 g. Drilling holes through is another possibility. 
	Replacing the groove with a hole circle centered between the sides of the groove has 
	a circumference of 1.37", which would allow 3.66 3/8" holes to be drilled. Smaller 
	holes would be necessary and the extra weight removed would be minimal.
</p>

<p>
	Based on the shape of some yo-yos on the internet a second possibility for mass 
	removal is slicing off a wedge shape from the inside face creating a cone of sorts. 
	Starting at 1/2" diameter and cutting all the way to the edge so only 1/8" remains 
	on the edge, i.e. a 3/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;7/8" triangular cross section, removes 42% of 
	the weight. The yo-yo would then weigh about 86 gms. This would be a 23.2&deg; bevel 
	angle.
</p>

<p>
	The compound was installed on the Sherline lathe after filing a too thick tee nut. 
	The compound was set to 67&deg;. Cutting was done by moving the the carriage back 
	0.010" in the y-direction. A pass was made. Care had to be taken as the cutter 
	approached the outside edge of the workpiece. If moving too fast the yo would pop off 
	of the chuck, as it is only held on by 1/8". The cutting was slow, but effective. 
	The cutting was stopped when the inside diameter was 1/2". This left a slightly 
	larger than 1/8" rim thickness. The first photo shows the cut in progress and the 
	second compares the finished cut to a full width piece.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY cutting bevel.heic" alt="Cutting the bevel on a rough cut part." width="1389" height="1599">
<img class=inline src="images/YY bevel compare.heic" alt="The completed beveled wheel compared to a full width wheel." width="1027" height="1351">

<p>
	The bevel was repeated on a second part. The edges were cleaned up with file and 
	sandpaper. The parts were not sanded, but went straight to the buffing wheel. The 
	yo-yo after polishing and cleaning is shown below. This yo-yo is certainly a lot 
	lighter than the previous and still spins nicely on a string. However, with the 
	bearing in place I cannot get the yo-yo to rise back up the string. Winding the 
	string is also difficult.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY bevel polished.heic" alt="The polished double bevel yo-yo." width="1050" height="1237">

<p>
	The bearing was replaced in the angled yo-yo with a bushing made from brass tube. The 
	tube is 0.25" OD and 3/16" ID. It was cut off at 0.15". The yo-yo now functions 
	correctly, but does seem to readily hang at an angle. The two halves were measured at 
	40 and 43 grams. How close do they need to be? A rough approximation of the amount 
	of material to remove goes as follows. The width of the yo is 1.25 cm, so the area of 
	its unreduced perimeter is 1.25&nbsp;X&nbsp;&pi;&nbsp;X&nbsp;5.7&nbsp;=&nbsp;22.4&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>. 
	Removing 0.05 mm would drop the weight by 3 gms. These yos with a 1/8" wide perimeter 
	require reducing the diameter by .2 mm, which would be noticeable, so any material 
	removed needs to come from the face or the interior angle.
</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, removing a centimeter from the reduced section of the face would 
	decrease the weight by 4.19 gms. Removing 0.028" will remove 3 grams of aluminum.
	Back to the lathe. The heavier half was chucked in the three jaw chuck on the South 
	Bend lathe after making new soft jaws from an old license plate. A few minutes was 
	spent aligning the yo and then 0.025" was removed from the bore with a boring bar. 
	The yo now weighed 41 gms. The yo was polished and washed. After assembly the yo-yo 
	was tried out. It no longer twists to one side, success!
</p>

<p>
	There is no good way to hold the yos with rounded corners for cutting the angle. Two 
	new yos were made this morning on the South Bend lathe. The blanks were cut 5/8" thick 
	and then faced, drilled and countersunk. After flipping the opposite side was faced 
	and the width was reduced to 1/2". This opposite face was bored as above.
</p>

<p>
	The next morning each yo was held in the Sherline via the bored face. The compound 
	was set at 67&deg; and 0.0075" cuts were made across the inside face until the edge 
	was 1/8" wide. The edges were sanded at this point. Both yos were polished as before 
	and then washed with soap and water. They are shown in the photo below. They were 
	weighed and both weighed 42 gms. A piece of brass tube was parted off at 0.150". A 
	set screw was shortened to 0.60" and the second yo-yo was assembled. Works like a 
	charm.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY both complete.heic" alt="The completed pair of yo-yos." width="3136" height="2071">

<p>
	Boxes for the yo-yos were next. The plan is to make custom boxes with cutouts for the 
	yo-yos, extra string, and the bearing. If the kids get really good, they can figure 
	out how to use the bearing. Some wood was selected, red oak and mahogany(?). Both the 
	lid and box will be made of two layers of contrasting wood. The wood was cut to 
	approximate size, 3&nbsp;1/4&nbsp;X&nbsp;4&nbsp;3/8". After cutting the wood to size 
	the wood was glued together as seen in the next two photos. The blanks were removed 
	from the clamps after two hours, but won't be worked until tomorrow.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY lid part.heic" alt="A pair of wood scraps glued for part of the lid." width="2199" height="1986">

<p>
	After removing the clamps the blocks were held on the workbench and planed. This did 
	a good job producing smooth surfaces, but left the edges angled. My planing technique 
	is poor. The one lid part was planed to remove glue squeeze out and then glued to one 
	of the three dark/light glued blocks sandwiching the darker wood as seen below. After 
	significant wood removal this block will become two lids.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY lid glueup.heic" alt="A third layer added to the future lids." width="2657" height="2379">

<p>
	The blocks were cut to size on the table saw. The large double top block was difficult 
	to cut to size without leaving 1/2" or so of a ridge as I didn't want to set the blade 
	high enough to cut all the way through in one pass. This block was finished on the 
	belt sander. The before and after shots are seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY before sizing.heic" alt="The blocks before cutting to size." width="3039" height="1788">
<img class=inline src="images/YY after sizing.heic" alt="The blocks after cutting to size." width="1978" height="2179">

<p>
	The holes will be drilled and then the blocks will be sanded. Drilling the holes for 
	the yo-yos is problematic. I don't have a sufficiently large hole saw. The largest is 
	2&nbsp;1/4", which is the diameter of the yo-yos. I have an adjustable hole saw, 
	shown below, which can be opened to 2&nbsp;1/2", slightly more than the 2&nbsp;3/8" 
	desired. The drill that is integral to this saw is long enough to cut through the 
	block as the hole reaches depth. (The goal is to completely bury the yo-yo in the 
	block.) Two other possibilities for making the holes are by boring on the South Bend 
	lathe or by milling with the aid of a rotary table. In any of these approaches the 
	hole center will be 1&nbsp;7/16" in from the short side of the block and centered 
	between the long sides.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY hole saw.heic" alt="The hole saw set for cutting a 2 3/8" hole."." width="1699" height="1702">

<p>
	Decided not to use the hole saw as I didn't want to plug a hole in the bottom of the 
	box. Instead the lathe was used. The center of the desired hole was marked and the 
	block was placed in the four jaw chuck with the hole on center as determined by a 
	tailstock center. First a hole was drilled with a 1&nbsp;1/8" spade bit to a depth 
	of 1". This depth ensured that the point of the bit did not penetrate the box bottom. 
	The hole was then widened and deepened with a boring bar in 0.020" depth increments. 
	The garage shop was cold, so only one block was completed. The hole was bored to a 
	depth of 1.20" and is a nice fit for the yo-yo, leaving room for eventual felting.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY hole boring.heic" alt="The hole being bored in the block using the boring bar in the lathe."." width="2530" height="2417">

<p>
	The second hole was finished this morning in an even colder garage. After sanding off 
	the fuzzies, the two boxes and matching lids are shown below. I am no longer sure the 
	lighter wood is red oak. The sawdust is definitely yellow! However, it does smell like 
	oak. The next steps are drilling the other two holes in each box and then affixing  
	lids. A 3/4" hole is planned for the extra string and a 3/8" hole for the bearing.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY two holes.heic" alt="Two holes bored and cleaned up with adjacent lids."." width="2540" height="3494">

<p>
	Both holes were marked 3/4" in from the short side and 3/4" in from the long side. 
	They were drilled for the 3/4" hole with a spade bit and with a brad point drill bit 
	for the smaller hole. After a bit of sanding around the hole edges the drilled blocks 
	are shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY six holes.heic" alt="Two more holes drilled and cleaned up."." width="2661" height="3069">

<p>
	The lid will rotate to open, attached via a wood screw in one corner. The opposite 
	corner will hold a magnet and a piece of steel, one in the lid and one in the box. 
	The screws will be round headed brass wood screws, which I don't happen to have. Off 
	to Menards. The screws were purchased along with two other items for other projects. 
	The next step was tapering the edges of the box tops. The table saw was raised 1" and 
	tilted 10&deg;. With the fence sitting close enough that the top of the blade was 
	about 1/16" still in the wood of the top the tops were cut. The shorter ends were cut 
	first followed by the longer sides in an effort to remove any tearout from the ends. 
	This was successful as shown in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY tapered tops.heic" alt="The tops after tapering all four edges providing a framed look."." width="2817" height="2210">

<p>
	The box tops were clamped to the boxes with two sides flush using a large pinch clamp. 
	Using the belt sander the sides of the boxes were sanded until all sides and top edges 
	were flush. The boxes at this stage are shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY fit sanding.heic" alt="The boxes after sanding together to size."." width="3782" height="2206">

<p>
	More drilling, this time for attaching the lid. The lids were marked on the corner 
	near the large hole and opposite the smallest hole 1/4" in from each edge. These 
	distances were checked with a scrap of paper to make sure the box would rotate out of 
	the way of the large hole and yo-yo removal. The box and lid were clamped on the drill 
	press with the center punch in the chuck aligned with the mark. A flat was milled into 
	the lid just enough to see a full circle with a 5/16" end mill. The box and lid were 
	drilled about 1" deep with the drill for the minor thread diameter of these #8 screws. 
	The lid was then drilled for the major diameter as a through hole. On the opposite 
	corner a second hole was drilled for a short #8 screw and countersunk, 5/16" in from 
	each edge. After dropping and losing the pieces of steel cut off for the magnet, 
	screws were substituted. The photo below shows the results of this effort. Only the 
	hole for the lid magnet remains.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/YY lid screw.heic" alt="The boxes after drilling and installing the two screws."." width="2273" height="2520">

	The magnets and covers were next. Each of the lids was held on the milling vise with 
	strap clamps. The marked spot was centered under the spindle and drilled with a 0.189" 
	drill to 0.188" deep as determined by setting the drill point even with the surface of 
	the lid. The drill was switched for a 1/4" end mill, which opened the hole and 
	provided a flat bottom. A 1/2" end mill was used to make a 1/16" deep countersink. 
	The magnets didn't quite fit so the holes were reamed with a 1/4" reamer. A compass 
	was used to draw two 1/2" diameter circles on a scrap of 1/16" veneer left from the 
	veneered box class. The circles were cut out with a chisel and sanded to size. Two 
	part epoxy was prepared and spread into the hole. An air gap was made at the edge of 
	the 1/4" hole, then the magnet was pressed in place. A bit more epoxy and the circle 
	of veneer was pressed into the countersink serving as a cover for the magnet. The 
	steps of this process are seen in the three photos below.

	Lots of sanding this morning. The bottoms of the lids where the magnet and veneer were 
	proud was sanded on the belt sander. The bottoms and the lids were sanded all over with 
	150- and 220-grit paper, about fifty strokes per area. The end grain on both lids 
	and bottoms were further sanded with 320- and 400-grit paper. The edges were all 
	lightly chamfered with 220-grit paper. The sanding table was utilized and again did 
	a great job of minimizing dust in my nose. The dust on the parts was first removed 
	with vacuum and then with air blown from the vacuum vent port. After finding no 
	shellac in the house, wipe-on polyurethane was selected as the finish. A first coat 
	was wiped on. The two photos below show the sanded and the first coat of wipe-on poly.

<p>
	The poly must wait 2-3 hours before the next coat and has to be lightly sanded with 
	220-grit paper between coats. Two more coats were applied with light sanding between 
	each coat. I am not thrilled with the finish. The poly does not seem to build up and 
	the finish looks dull. I will let it dry for a couple of days and apply some paste 
	wax. That may provide the sheen I am seeking.
</p>

<p>
	Felting was explored by cutting a piece of felt with scissors 1&nbsp;1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;7&nbsp;1/2". 
	This was wrapped around the inside of the large hole. It needed 1/4-3/8" removed to fit. 
	A yo-yo slid in with no room to spare. Removing the yo-yo reminded me that I need to 
	put a notch in the side of the hole to make yo-yo removal easier. The poly does not 
	seem completely dry, so notch filing will wait a day or so minimizing the dust 
	sticking to the finish.

<p>
	Paste wax was applied to the yo-yo boxes and then buffed out. After two days finger 
	prints are still left on the finish?! The notch was filed and then sanded in the 
	side of the large hole as seen in the photo below.

	Instead of carving the boy's names into the box tops an engraved plaque will be used. 
	Two brass blanks were cut from a sheet of 1/32" brass. They were approximately 
	1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2", sized to fit on the center raised portion of the tops. The corners 
	were rounded with a file and the edges deburred. China white was applied and the 
	boy's names were written on to the plaques with a pencil. The names were then 
	engraved with a freshly sharpened 105&deg; chisel. The names engraved onto the brass 
	can be seen in the photo below.
</p>

<p>
	After some indecision on the best way to attach the plaques the following was chosen. 
	A simple jig was made using carpet tape to hold two blocks of wood onto a wood base 
	forming a right angled pocket. This jig was held in the milling table vise and the 
	spindle was aligned 0.12" in from each side of this angle. A plaque was held in the 
	jig against this corner and drilled with a #32 drill, 0.116". All four corners of both 
	plaques were drilled in a few minutes. The holes were transferred to the box lids, 
	drilled with a #42 drill, and tapped 4-40. The first photo below shows a drilled 
	plaque resting on the simple jig. The second shows an unpolished plaque screwed in 
	place on the box lid.

<p>
	The brass plaques were first lightly sanded with 600 grit paper to remove burrs from 
	the engraving. They were then polished on the wheel using red rouge. The steel screw 
	heads were polished on a wheel using green rouge. Finally the brass screw heads were 
	polished as well. All parts were cleaned, soap and water, followed by acetone and 
	then painted with varnish (the steel screws were not varnished). A second coat of 
	varnish was applied to the brass parts.
</p>

<p>
	The boxes were felted next. Felt was found in the red tool chest in a few colors. 
	Ruby was chosen for Levi's box and a bright blue for Ollie's. Pieces were cut 1&nbsp;1/8" 
	wide and trimmed to the length of the trial green piece cut earlier. A notch was cut 
	about half-way along the strip to match the notches in the boxes. A square was cut 
	out of each color felt as well at 2&nbsp;3/8" on a side. These squares were trimmed 
	to circles. Glue was squirted into the bottom of the large hole and spread around and 
	up the sides. The circle was set in the bottom and the long rectangle was wrapped 
	around the inside wall with the notches aligned. After a bit of straightening the 
	felt was firmly pressed into place and left to dry. The photo below shows the two 
	felted holes still wet with glue.

<p>
	An attempt was made to complete the boxes this morning. The engraved plates were 
	screwed to the box lid. A drop of epoxy was placed in the pivot screw holes and the 
	screws were put in place. Glue squeeze out was carefully removed before tightening 
	the screws to full depth. The lids turn nicely. The photos below show the boxes in 
	both the open and closed positions.

<p>
	Putting the yo-yos in place indicated a problem. The yo-yo in Ollie's box sits  
	proud keeping the lid from seating on the box when closed. The gap is obvious 
	and the magnet is now too far away to hold. Tightening the two halves of the yo-yo 
	reduced its height from 1.125" to 1.105", still leaving the yo-yo about 1/64" proud. 
	Either the hole must be made deeper, but I don't know how, or the yo-yo can be made 
	shorter by taking off some material in the lathe and polishing the yo-yo again.
</p>

<p>
	The reduction and polishing went reasonably well. The yo-yo now fits in the box with 
	the lid closed. The photo below shows the two yo-yos in their boxes, bringing this 
	project mostly to a close. As seen in the photo extra strings were cut, ends melted, 
	and tied before placing them in the provided holes. I still plan on putting a screw 
	through a bearing in the last hole, though I doubt it will ever be used.

<p>
	The final task, installing the bearings was completed this morning. Two brass 1/2"-#4 
	screws were installed in the smallest holes with the bearings after pre-drilling the 
	holes for the screws.
