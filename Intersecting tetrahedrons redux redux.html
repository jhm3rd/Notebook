<p class=first>
	Well, it has been long enough that I would like to reinitiate the Intersecting 
	Tetrahedrons project. I have sufficiently recovered from the disappointment of 
	the last effort to begin fresh. Hopefully, many of the learnings from the second 
	attempt will enable this third attempt to deliver the wooden stellated icosahedron. 
	The "too big to fit" problem arose because the angle of the bar's triangular cross 
	section changed from 30&deg; to 35.25&deg;. This resulted in a base width of 1". 
	This iteration will have bars that are 10"&nbsp;X&nbsp;5/8". With a top included 
	angle of 70.5&deg; the bottom of the triangle will then be 0.870" (or 7/8"), which 
	was the original base width when the included angle was 60&deg;. The ratio of 
	triangle height to bar length is 14.8, significantly larger than the recommended 12. 
	But I don't think the ratio is so big that the tetrahedra will move around 
	excessively. <a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebooki/Five Intersecting Tetrahedra.pdf">"Project Origami"</a> 
	has a good description of optimizing the length vs. width of the bars as well as a 
	set of diagrams for assembling the final model.
</p>

<p>
	I plan to make the legs from 1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2" stock. Poplar is the least expensive 
	step up from pine and should be pretty clean wood. Of course the milled size is 
	3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/2". Four 8' lengths should provide thirty-six 10" blanks. 
	I will cut the boards to the requisite 10" length prior to ripping to the desired 
	5/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;7/8" size. The 8' lengths were cut by hand at 53" to give a second 
	piece 43" long. These lengths were cut to 10&nbsp;1/8" using a table stop and the 
	cross cut sled. After cutting these 10" lengths and a few extra a stop was clamped 
	to the cross cut sled and the parts were accurately cut to 10.0". They were then 
	ripped to 5/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/8" with the rip fence and a featherboard. The 
	37 blanks are shown below.

<p>
	So far I have not been able to find the jig used in <a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Intersecting%20tetrahedrons%20redux.html">
	Tetrahedron Redux</a> for cutting the triangular cross section. Therefore a new jig 
	is planned. The jig was cut from a 3/4" scrap of oak. It was about 12" long and was 
	cut into two pieces about 8" and 6" wide. The blade was carefully angled to 35.25&deg; 
	off of vertical and both parts were cut on the long side. The smaller part was drilled 
	for three holes to fit 1/4" bolts. The top was place in the first cut position (i.e. 
	a vertical side was 1&nbsp;1/16" from the angled edge of the bottom and clamped. The 
	holes were transfered making sure the top was parallel with the bottom. The holes in 
	the top part were countersunk pretty deep. 1/4" holes were drilled in the bottom and 
	the bottom part was countersunk on the bottom side with a 3/4" Forstner bit about 
	halfway through the board. The parts were joined with bolts, washers and nuts. 
	Separate holes need to be drilled for the second cut, but I would like to set the 
	appropriate distance when a suitably cut part is in hand. A 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3"&nbsp;X&nbsp;8" 
	piece of scrap was attached to the end of the bottom with three screws to serve as 
	a stop. The jig is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="intTRR/Tet 3 cross section jig.jpg" alt="Jig for cutting the bar cross section" width="2665" height="2319">

<p>
	When getting ready to use the jig, I realized it was missing any clamping ability. 
	This was remedied by adding an end plate at the far end with a screw through it. A 
	1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3" scrap was drilled and tapped 1/4-20. Two through 
	holes for attachment screws were also drilled and countersunk. The screw holes were 
	transfered, the end plate was screwed in place and a 2" bolt and lock nut were 
	threaded into position. The jig was a little long so a small block was used as the 
	clamp on the part to be cut. The two pictures below show the jig as used. To use, the 
	jig is clamped to the miter fence such that the blade just barely rotates freely. 
	The jig needs to be held tight to the table before clamping it to the miter gauge. 
	The part to be cut is inserted and secured with the screw, clamping block and lock 
	nut. 
</p>

<p>
	Cut all of the parts on this first setting establishing the first angle of the 
	triangular cross section. Now to determine the new setting for the second cut. The 
	position of the top slide was approximated and then the holes were transfered from 
	the bottom to the top. The holes were drilled 1/4" and then slots were cut on the 
	mill and the slots were chamfered. Now the top can be adjusted so I can sneak up on 
	the second cut. After careful measurement of 7/8" across the length of the jig, the 
	first cut was made. The width of the base of the triangle is closer to 3/4" than 
	7/8", but the top is just cutting to the line of the previous cut. I don't 
	understand the reason for the difference in size, but have decided to go with it. 
	After cutting about a dozen bars the bar started to rattle slightly when beginning 
	the cut. On the first cut this meant the bar was not held tightly enough and a twist 
	on the screw clamp fixed the problem. This time further tightening the screw clamp 
	did not help. It may be because the block between screw and part is smaller. To add 
	further clamping support some sandpaper was in order. A small scrap of sandpaper was 
	epoxied to the end of the clamp block and trimmed to fit. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	Epoxy was used because the 3M spray adhesive would no longer spray, even through an 
	unused nozzle. The can was clearly full of adhesive.
</p>

<p>
	The sandpaper was effective even though the epoxy had not completely dried. After a 
	few cuts it was necessary to use a wrench to tighten the screw and the lock nut as 
	my hands got sore. All of the bars were cut to the required triangular cross section. 
	The jig in the second cut configuration and the 37 cut bars are shown below.
</p>

<p>
	The jig used for cutting the ends of the bars was found and then used to cut the ends. 
	The blade was set at a 45&deg; angle as was the miter gauge. The phone was again 
	used to set the blade angle and the framing square was used to set the miter angle. 
	The blade was amazingly well aligned with the previous cut! The jig was clamped to 
	the miter gauge with two bar clamps. It was adjusted so the blade just touched the 
	end. A bar was clamped in and cut just going past the tip. A number of bars were cut 
	on both ends. One of the bar clamps loosened over time. I could see that some of the 
	bars were now about 1/16" shorter than before. The clamp was retightened and cutting 
	proceeded. Now the bars are slightly longer than the first batch. Most of this 
	should get cleaned up in the second pass. We shall see! The jig as set up for a cut 
	is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="intTRR/Tet 3 end cutting jig.jpg" alt="Bar end cutting jig" width="2137" height="2163">

<p>
	After cutting the first angle on the ends the miter gauge was reset for -45&deg; via 
	the same framer's square procedure described above. The second angle was cut on all 
	of the the ends. This time the clamps were periodically checked for tightness. The 
	bars were aligned slightly proud (1/64") at the cutting end. This gave symmetrical 
	cuts. The seven shortest bars were used for a test fit with the rubber band/paper 
	clip clamping system. This is shown in the following picture. The rubber bands are 
	not very tight. The paper clips probably need to be folded in half to provide 
	adequate tension. A little sanding, followed by priming and painting will pave the 
	way for glue-up. I decided to prime the bars prior to sanding. They were quite 
	smooth from the table saw and they will need sanding after the primer. The second 
	picture below shows the "vampire stakes" primed with Killz (sic) (the version with silver 
	nanoparticles).

<p>
	The bars were painted today. The two smaller sides were painted and after about 2 
	hours the larger side was painted. All of the paint dried quickly. The picture below 
	shows the chosen colors. This is the same acrylic paint used before, though the 
	color choices are not identical. An extra bar was painted in each color. These may 
	serve as backups or they may be made into a free-standing tetrahedron just for the 
	heck of it.

	The first tetrahedron was glued up this morning. Decided to use wood glue. 
	Experimented a bit yesterday and the setup time seemed long enough, about 5+ minutes. 
	I adjusted the paper clips on the rubber bands, but the harness still seems a little 
	loose. I again used a weight to hold the glued bottom three bars and then added the 
	top bars individually. The first results can be seen in the picture below. A very 
	nice fit and easily clamped first tetrahedron. Gluing the interpenetrating tetrahedra 
	gets ever more challenging from here on.
</p>

<img class=inline src="intTRR/Tet 3 first glue.jpg" alt="The first tetrahedron glued up and 'clamped''" width="1447" height="2041">

<p>
	A triangular hole was cut into a box where a point of the glued tetrahedron will sit. 
	The points of the triangular hole approximately corresponded to the midpoints of the 
	bars. Wax paper with a similar hole cut into it was placed over the box with holes 
	aligned. The rubber band harness was put in place such that all vertices of the glued tetrahedron 
	went through holes in the sides of the harness with all of the bands outside the 
	tetrahedron. It was aligned to capture each of the four vertices of the new 
	tetrahedron. The glued tetrahedron was placed into the hole point down. Three blue 
	bars were laid around the hole. The ends of the three horizontal bars were pushed 
	through the corresponding rubber bands and covered with glue. An end of each of the 
	three remaining bars was glued, inserted through the top rubber band of the harness, 
	inserted through a bottom rubber band capturing its vertex, and aligned with a bottom 
	vertex. The top ends of these vertical bars were covered with glue. The top vertex 
	was aligned as were the bottom three vertices. It all came together with minimal 
	fiddling. The picture below shows the pair of tetrahedra just after gluing.
</p>

<p>
	In order to thread in the bars for the third tetrahedron the first two were held 
	together with two rubber bands. This kept these first two reasonably stable. The 
	two glued tetrahedra were supported on blocks in an orientation similar to that 
	shown in the above reference. The green bars were then threaded through the pair of 
	tetrahedra and held loosely in place with a rubber band for each bar. The harness 
	was put around the whole and the unglued bars were put through the appropriate 
	rubber bands. Then the support rubber bands for the new bars and the bands holding 
	the two glued tetrahedra were removed. With a lot of adjusting the bars could be 
	arranged into a pretty good tetrahedron. The challenge is a couple of bars on the 
	bottom provide some support and consequently want to rotate out of the correct 
	orientation. I will need to think about how to better manage the orientation of the 
	bars prior to gluing. But at least they fit!!!
</p>

<img class=inline src="intTRR/Tet 3 third in place.jpg" alt="The third tetrahedron in place" width="1657" height="1767">

<p>
	Glued up!! That was a pain in the derrière! I just went for it. Glue was applied to 
	all of the ends and then each vertex was adjusted repetitively to align the bars. 
	After some cursing it eventually went together and after more fiddling/cursing I was 
	satisfied with the four joints. The drying glue actually helped to stabilize one 
	joint while working with another. I am not satisfied with the support that I have 
	for the two completed tetrahedra. 
</p>

<p>
	I had it and then I lost it!!. What was going through my head four years ago when I 
	got on this rollercoaster? The three tetrahedra were planed a bit on the vertices 
	to remove glue. (Touch up will come last.) I arranged the three tetrahedra as shown 
	in the picture and carefully inserted three bars for the the fourth. They fit nicely. 
	I then removed the three bars in order to put in rubber bands for support. Enough 
	movement of the three tetrahedra ensued to mess up the alignment. I spent the next 
	hour trying to recreate the right arrangement with no success. So I slept on it. This 
	morning I was able to recreate the picture in the pdf and insert all of the bars for 
	the fourth tetrahedron. The picture below shows the fourth tetrahedron with harness 
	in place just prior to glue-up. Gluing this one was not quite as successful as the 
	first three. The alignment is not quite as good for some reason, but it is good 
	enough. After letting it dry the vertices were "trued" up a bit with the chisel.
</p>

<p>
	The vertices that had been scraped, sanded, or chiseled were primed. This included 
	all but a couple of the blue, second tetrahedron, vertices. The paint was left to dry 
	overnight. The final bars were put in this morning. I wasn't sure this was going to 
	be possible as the fit seemed to be getting tighter with each new tetrahedron. Once 
	I was able to orient the four tetrahedra with the picture in the reference, the bar 
	placement was obvious and they pretty much slid right into place. The ends did not all 
	meet perfectly, but with glue and 5 minute finger clamping the vertices are all 
	respectable. While the glue was drying on the yellow tetrahedron the primed red 
	vertices were painted. The stellated icosahedron was suspended from the stored vise 
	and the remaining primed vertices were painted. Only the yellow vertices remain to 
	be cleaned up, primed and painted. The picture below shows the almost finished 
	product. Notice the characteristic pentagon in the center.
</p>

<img class=inline src="intTRR/Tet 3 fifth glued.jpg" alt="The fifth tetrahedron glued and most painting finished" width="1509" height="1671">

<p>
	The rubber band harness and the rubber bands used for holding the pre-glued bars 
	in place were removed. The yellow vertices were cleaned up with a chisel. Some 
	vertices needed significant work to get an acceptably smooth transition to a point. 
	These final four vertices were then primed and left to dry for a few hours. Meanwhile 
	the remaining six painted bars, one of each color, were glued up into a tetrahedron. 
	The fit was better than expected, given that three different length bars were used. 
	Four primed yellow vertices were painted this morning with the medium yellow acrylic 
	paint. The five intersecting tetrahedra are complete! The photos and video below 
	show it in all of its glory.

<video class=inline src="intTRR/Tet 3 spinning.MOV" controls width="45%" height="45%" alt=" The five intersecting tetrahedra spinning"></video>

<p class="note">
	The fit as mentioned got tighter and tighter with each additional tetrahedron. The 
	final product has no free play at all. The ratio of bar height (5/8") to bar length 
	(10&nbsp;3/4") is 17.2 and could not have been a single <em>iota</em> smaller! I do 
	not know why a ratio this much larger than the reference recommends (12-14) was 
	required. I can only guess it is due to the different angles of the triangular cross 
	section. A little luck made up for my mediocre planning!
