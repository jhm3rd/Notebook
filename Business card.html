<p class=first>
	I have always been intrigued by a business card plan seen many years ago. I no 
	longer know where it came from. It houses a set of planetary gears. I finally 
	decided to make it. My first attempt is making it from brass stock that is 1/32" 
	thick. I have 1/16" stock if this proves too thin. The parts seen in the plan below 
	will be referred to (starting from the left) as front, back, and middle.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Planetary card.png" alt="Planetary business card plan" width="1496" height="700">

<p>
	Some brass flat stock was found. It is 1/32"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;10". Three 
	pieces were cut from this stock. Two, front and back, were slightly longer than 3" 
	and one, the middle, slightly longer than 3&nbsp;1/8". The middle part including the 
	large internally toothed gear will be made by cutting out the gear on a rotary table. 
	Using a 1/16" end mill requires the plate to be 1/8" longer for the waste. I plan to 
	leave the cards oversize and cut them to size after clamping them together. The 
	corner holes will also be drilled at this time. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC brass plates.jpg" alt="Three brass plates for the card" width="1496" height="700">

<p>
	The openings in the top card will also be cut on the rotary table. Cutting the gear 
	teeth will initially be attempted by rough cutting on the scroll saw followed by hand 
	filing. It is possible that the gear teeth on the five small gears could be cut with 
	one of the gear cutters I already have. 
</p>

<p>
	The plan dimensions are as follows. The card is 1.844"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2.938". The large 
	wheel diameter is 1.813". The inner diameter of the large wheel is 1.469". The 
	central wheel diameter is slightly less than 0.656". The planetary gears are 0.563" 
	in diameter. Tooth length is 0.078". Tooth width is 0.063". The planetary gears have 
	14 teeth, the central gear has 17 teeth, and the large gear has 45 internal teeth.
</p>

<p>
	The gear cutting parameters were calculated. Diametral Pitch = (# of teeth + 2)/O.D.
	The DP of the planetary and central gears are 28.4 and 28.9 respectively. The gear 
	cutters I have are DP = 30. This would result in using smaller blanks for the two 
	gear sizes: 0.533" and 0.633". The size of the outer wheel would have to expand 
	accordingly. I don't know how to do this and determine the number of teeth for this 
	newly sized gear. So either two gear cutters (6 & 7) need to be made or purchased. 
	Alternatively, a hob might be the best way to go.
</p>

<p>
	The middle part was marked for a center hole. A 0.089" (#43 drill) hole was drilled 
	through after centering the spindle over the mark with the new slip-on spud. A 3/4" 
	block of wood was cut to fit the part and marked for a hole. This hole was drilled 
	through 7/16" in the drill press to fit the rotary table adaptor. Once the part was 
	carpet taped to the block and clamped in place, the table was centered under the 
	spindle. The table was moved 0.906" and locked on both axes. A 1/16" end mill was 
	used to cut the circle in increments of 0.005". The picture shows the result.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC circle cut.jpg" alt="Circle cut in the middle brass plate" width="2186" height="1716">

<p class="note">
	Of course that was the wrong distance to move the table. It needed 1/32" less. 
	This means the circle gear will have a slightly smaller O.D. This should not matter 
	if the inner circle is cut to the correct size. Should have taken the time to do 
	the layout.
</p>

<p>
	The outside of the cutter is now 1/32" beyond the correct size of the wheel at 0.937". 
	The outside of the cutter needs to be inside the inner circle to cut it correctly. 
	The radius of the inner circle is 0.7345". So the part needs to move back 0.203" for 
	the 1/16" end mill to cut the inner circle of the doughnut.
</p>

<p>
	Change in plans. Instead of cutting out the large gear circle first, the inner gear 
	will be removed first. That way one clamp setup will serve for both cuts. There is 
	also more room for the clamps when cutting the inner gear. The inside of the end mill 
	is sitting at 0.937" - 1/16" = 0.875". The inner gear is 0.641" in diameter. 
	Consequently, the table needs to move back toward center 0.555". This was done and 
	the inner gear circle was cut free.
</p>

<p>
	Now the outside of the end mill is at 0.3205" + 1/16" = 0.383". The outside of the 
	end mill needs to be at radius 0.735", so the table needs to move back out 0.352" to 
	cut the inner side of the large gear wheel. Again the table was moved and the wheel 
	was cut loose. The clamps were not moved for these last two cuts. The carpet tape was 
	sufficient to hold everything tight for both cuts. 
</p>

<p>
	The width of the gap between the teeth of the large wheel is 1/16" at the inner 
	diameter. The plan is to start the teeth with the end mill and finish with a file. 
	The end mill from its current position can cut 1/32" deep into the circle to reveal 
	the beginnings of the teeth. The wheel has 45 teeth. The teeth are 8&deg; apart. The 
	spindle was moved to about touching and the z-axis set to 0. The table was rotated 
	until it was also at zero. With the x-axis locked the spindle was lowered 0.015" and 
	the y-axis was moved 0.031". The table was lowered another 0.015" for a second cut 
	and again for a third cut. Everything was returned to initial positions taking care 
	to remove the backlash in both the y- and z-axes. The table was rotated 8&deg; and 
	the second gap between teeth was cut. After repeating this 43 more times the initial 
	gaps were completed. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC large gear cut.jpg" alt="All of the teeth partially cut in the large gear" width="2272" height="1983">

<p>
	The same process was followed for the central gear with 17 teeth. The table was 
	moved back 0.352" to place the edge of the cutter against the central gear. A 
	spreadsheet was made to calculate the rotary table settings for each of the cuts. 
	The seventeen cuts were made as above 1/32" into the wheel. The last few cuts were
	only partial as unbeknownst to me the gear came partly loose. They are sufficiently 
	marked for filing.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC central gear cut.jpg" alt="All of the teeth partially cut in the central gear" width="1285" height="935">

<p>
	The parts were removed from the block and the excess carpet tape glue was cleaned 
	off with mineral spirits. The two gears were "painted" with a Sharpie prior to 
	marking. The large internal gear was held on the outside of the jaws in a three-jaw 
	chuck. A sharp cutting tool was aligned with the tip of a tooth. The cross slide 
	was moved 0.072". A circle was scratched on the brass marking the depth of cut. 
	Similarly, the central gear was held in the chuck aligned with a 5/16" drill. Again 
	the cutting tool tip was aligned with the tooth top and the carriage moved 0.072" 
	prior to scratching the gear. The pictures below tell the story.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC gears marked.jpg" alt="The two gears marked for finish cutting" width="1363" height="1331">

<p>
	The gears were cut with a hack saw blade. This produced a square cut at the center 
	of the end mill cut. The cut was made down to the line. This was done on both the 
	large gear and the central gear.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC hacksawed gear.jpg" alt="The large gear after cutting with the hacksaw" width="1204" height="1400">

<p>
	Filing was tackled next with a needle file having a skinny trapezoidal cross section. 
	The large internal gear required significant thinning of the teeth and shaping so 
	they were not so triangular. The central gear required less filing, but some of the 
	teeth seemed to be at an angle. This was most likely due to a hacksaw cut that was 
	not square. For the most part the central gear can rotate in the large gear. The 
	thinning of the teeth in the large gear between the two photos below.

<img class=inline src="images/PC meshed gears.jpg" alt="The large gear and central gear meshed" width="1410" height="1282">

<p>
	The card proper needs a number of things done to complete it. The openings in the 
	top sheet need to be cut out using the rotary table. The three sheets need to be 
	clamped/glued to one another to have the edges cleaned up, the corners drilled, and 
	the round openings cut into two sides.
</p>

<p>
	The openings in the top sheet are essentially arcs from two circles. The inner series 
	of six arcs are 1/4" wide, while the outer series are 3/16" wide. The outer sides of 
	the inner series of arcs are 15/16" in diameter. The inner diameter of the outer 
	series of arcs is 1&nbsp;1/4". O.D. is 1&nbsp;5/8". They are not designed to be cut 
	in one pass with an end mill. Only the outer corners of the outer series are rounded. 
	The rounded corners are about 1/16" radius. The ends are not on radii of the circle, 
	but are offset. The offset is 3/64" for the inner series and 3/32" for the outer 
	series. 
</p>

<p>
	I am having second thoughts about this project. The hand-formed gear teeth are pretty 
	poorly formed. Every step in this project seems to be more of an approximation than 
	an exact cut. The measurements are never exact. The gear teeth are not very good. 
	Even the top sheet will have to approximate the plan. Unfortunately, the 
	approximations add up to more errors. I am rethinking how I might redesign this 
	planetary card to fit better with the equipment I have at hand. I also need a better 
	way to make the teeth on these gears. I plan to review an old video I have on gear 
	making. It covers making a hob, which would be free as opposed to buying expensive 
	gear cutters. This might be a great opportunity to relearn Fusion 360 and make a 
	<a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Slotting%20attachment.html">
	slotting attachment</a> for the mill.
</p>

<p>
	The slotting attachment is completed, so it time to return to the business card. 
	After reading about internal gears it became clear to me that the parameters for 
	the internal gear are calculated the same as for a spur gear, except the internal 
	gear is inside out. Looking carefully at the gear profile for the internal gear in 
	the plan above makes this evident. The gaps between the teeth are shaped like spur 
	gear teeth and the teeth are shaped like the gaps in spur gears. The following two 
	tables summarize the best estimate of the three gears as measured from the plan and 
	what a true 30 DP set would be like. (This assumes a 20&deg; PA.)

	Here the PD's add up. 0.567 + 2(0.467) = 1.501 Though it probably makes sense to

</p>

<p>
	The middle plate has the squarest corner. This corner will be used to align the 
	other two cards prior to corner drilling and milling to size. The side indentations 
	will also be cut. These cuts will free up the middle plate, so the corners must be 
	drilled first. Consequently, the size of the opening is now determined. This opening 
	is 1.844" in diameter. The internal gear will be this diameter minus 1/64" or 1.828". 
	The internal gear will be cut on the rotary table. Leaving it in place sets it up to 
	use the slotting attachment for cutting the internal gear teeth.
</p>

<p>
	The plan for cutting the internal gear is as follows: tape a slightly oversized 
	square of brass to a block of wood that is center drilled to fit the rotary table 
	stub. Mill the square of brass to a 1.828" diameter circle. Mill a circle out of 
	this leaving a 1.567" diameter hole. Remove the cutout and then mill out the wood 
	leaving a depression in the center of the brass ring. Mill partial openings for the 
	45 gaps between the teeth. Use the slotting attachment to finish cutting these 
	openings.
</p>

<p class="note">
	The slotting attachment should be experimented with prior to doing any of the work 
	listed in the above paragraph. Tools should be made for the two needed profiles and 
	used to make a gear or two before experimenting on the real thing.
</p>

<p>
	Such an attempt was made this morning. The 1/4" tool steel that was pounded through 
	the slotting attachment ram was painted with Dykem and a gear cutting shape was 
	scratched into the top of the tool. The tool was ground with the new grinding wheels.
	Care was made to have at least 15&deg; of clearance as the hole in the ram for the 
	bit sits at 10&deg;. The bit was put into the ram and the slotting attachment was 
	installed on the mill. A scrap of 1/32" brass was attached to a block of wood with 
	carpet tape. 
</p>

<p>
	The cutting tool was aligned with the edge of the brass and it was slowly advanced 
	in 0.001-0.002" increments.The first thing noticed is that there is play in the 
	ram! The bottom bearing is not a tight fit, unlike the top bearing. This made 
	advancement somewhat tricky. After proceeding to a depth of about 0.090" cutting 
	was stopped for an assessment. The brass has a wider and rounder opening than the 
	tool bit should have provided. In addition the brass was clearly bent around the cut.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC slotting tool.jpg" alt="The ground tool in the ram" width="1634" height="1513">
<img class=inline src="images/PC cut bent.jpg" alt="The edge of the brass showing the bending" width="1273" height="1426">

<p>
	The ram runout needs to be fixed. This should improve the shape of the resulting cut. 
	The brass also needs a firmer support than provided by the block of wood. Maybe an 
	aluminum backing will prevent the bending.
</p>

<p>
	With the bearing on the ram repaired another attempt was made to cut with the 
	slotter. A scrap of brass was clamped to a piece of aluminum with two machinist's 
	clamps. One of the clamps was held in the vise. Cutting with the gear tooth-shaped 
	tool was attempted. There were two problems that arose. The vise did not hold the 
	clamp tightly enough for the pushing when the brass was sitting so far from the vise. 
	The second problem was the table was not moving correctly when dialing another 0.002"!
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC clamp 1.jpg" alt="Trying a new way to clamp the brass for cutting" width="1239" height="1223">

<p>
	The problems with the table were fixed by removing the handle, loosening the 
	retaining ring, pulling the screw hard to the right, tightening the ring, and 
	reattaching the handle. Some crap was also cleaned out of the handle. Another means 
	of holding clamps in the vise was devised. This system worked better except the 
	brass was not far enough above the vise to allow cutting fully through the brass. 
	A larger piece of aluminum needs to be found to give this arrangement a better test.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC clamp 2.jpg" alt="Trying a second way to clamp the brass for cutting" width="1716" height="1823">

<p>
	Before continuing with the outer gear the planetary gears will be tackled. A #7 
	gear cutter will be used. After a short break the planetary gears were tackled this 
	morning. A mandrel was made to hold the four 5/8" brass squares. A 2&nbsp;3/4" 
	length of 3/4" aluminum was cut and held in the lathe chuck. Both ends were faced. 
	A steady rest was used. One end was reduced to 0.164" for 1/2". This end was 
	threaded 8-32 with the tailstock die holder for 3/8". The pre-drilled brass squares 
	were placed on the mandrel followed by a washer and two nuts. The squares were 
	reduced to circles and then to 0.531". A further 3/4" of the mandrel was reduced to 
	0.55". The mandrel holding the gear blanks is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC mandrel and gears.jpg" alt="The mandrel with planetary gear blanks in place" width="1679" height="1598">

<p>
	Months later I am getting back to this project (March 31 to July 6). I didn't write 
	down the problem that led to temporary abandonment. Looking at the attempt to cut 
	the planetary gears gave a pretty good idea of the problem. The teeth look awful. A 
	steel washer was part of the problem. The rotations do not look even. The tooth shape 
	is all wrong. I am guessing that chatter was a major problem. Movement would 
	certainly account for the poor tooth shape. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC bad gears.jpg" alt="The mandrel and blanks with poorly formed teeth" width="2030" height="2959">

<p>
	The first thing to be done is making new planetary gear blanks. Five squares about 
	5/8" on a side were cut from the 1/32" brass sheet. They were marked for holes and 
	drilled with a #19 drill to fit the mandrel. The squares were put on the mandrel
	without a washer. Two nuts were used to hold them tight. They were turned down to 
	0.530". The mandrel still held in the three jaw chuck was moved to the Sherline 
	indexing table. The tailstock center was pushed tightly against the free end of the 
	mandrel.
</p>

<p>
	After measuring the length of the extended rack the <a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Tools/Calculator%20for%20Sherline%20Dividing%20Head.html">Calculator for the Sherline Dividing Head</a>
	was used to produce a table of rack offsets. The first gap was cut in increments of 
	0.005". It is slow going as the cutter wants to stall. The cut was made to a depth 
	of 0.072". The process is extremely loud, so it will be finished this afternoon when 
	Rhea is teaching dancing in the garage.
</p>

<p>
	Very slow going. It was shortened a bit by increasing the depth of cut to 0.010" for 
	the first five cuts. Six gaps have been cut so far. The next one will begin tomorrow 
	morning at offset 3.905". Four more were cut and then the spindle became so tight 
	it could not be turned?!? I had to turn the spindle backwards until it would be 
	loose enough to get through the remaining cuts. This lost the alignment. The cutter 
	was aligned as well as possible in the last gap cut.  All of the gaps are separated 
	by 0.3366. The last five cuts will be based on adding this to the measured position 
	of the rack.
</p>

<p>
	The cutter was centered as well as possible in the last slot cut. The rack was moved 
	-0.3366 and the next cut was made in ten passes as above. The rack was moved the 
	same amount and the the next cut made. Three more cuts were made to finish the 
	gears. The photo attempts to show how nice the teeth look. The end was cleaned up 
	with a file.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC good gears.jpg" alt="The mandrel and blanks with nicely formed teeth" width="1278" height="1666"">

<p>
	After the beating the setup took from the intense chatter, it was no surprise that 
	the chuck was very difficult to open. The nuts were removed from the mandrel. The 
	five gears were stuck together and were removed as a unit. The last gear (closest 
	to the mandrel) had burrs that were embedded in the aluminum behind it. This gear 
	came loose the easiest. The other gears required some sharp raps with a makeshift 
	hammer, the back of the mandrel. All gears were filed on both sides. The photo shows 
	the resulting five gears.

<p class="note">
	The problem with the gear cutting was discovered. The cutter holder is not all 
	concentric. The body of the holder was aligned to within 0.001" in the chuck. The 
	dial indicator was moved to the shaft that sits in the mill's collet. The shaft 
	was out of alignment 0.003" close to the body and 0.003" farther from the body. 
	The shaft needs to be remade <i>in situ</i>. It is not clear how to reconcile this 
	with the description of runout when this 
	<a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Slitting%20Saw%20Mandrel.html">gear holder</a> 
	was made. Attempted to make another this morning using a collet in the South Bend. 
	Unfortunately, the last step, threading, the die went on crooked! Should have single 
	pointed the threads. A new 
	<a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/SBT%20die%20holder.html">
	gear cutter holder</a> was made with many detours.
</p>

<p>
	The central gear was made this morning. Two square blanks slightly larger than 5/8" 
	were cut from 1/32" brass stock with a hacksaw. A hole was drilled in the center of 
	each with a 0.166" drill. The mandrel had to be remade by cutting off the threaded 
	portion, reducing 1/2" to 0.164" and threading it 8-32. The blanks were placed on 
	the new threaded shaft and a nut was tightened to hold them in place. The blanks 
	were reduced to 0.633" circles.
</p>

<p>
	The three jaw chuck holding the mandrel was moved from the lathe to the indexing 
	attachment. This was attached to the milling table. The #7 cutter was placed on the 
	cutter holder made above. (A #6 cutter should have been used for a 17 tooth gear, but 
	I don't have one.) The gear cutter was lowered to the top of the blanks and then 
	lowered 0.1075"&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.3165". The teeth were cut according to the offsets 
	produced by the 
	<a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Tools/Calculator%20for%20Sherline%20Dividing%20Head.html">
	Gear Cutting Calculator</a>. The teeth were cut to a 0.072" depth in ten decreasing 
	passes. The gears were removed and cleaned up with a file. Separating them was a 
	challenge, but one eventually overcome. The first picture below shows the completed 
	gears still in the mill. The second shows one of the two gears surrounded by four 
	planetary gears.

<p class="note">
	The new gear cutter holder worked well. The noise was significantly less painful than 
	when cutting the planetary gears. It was also obvious that more teeth were engaged 
	in cutting. A successful, but not perfect, gear cutter holder.
</p>

<p>
	The internal gear was next on the agenda. A square of brass, 1.875" on a side, was 
	taped to a similarly sized square of 1/8" aluminum, which was taped to a same sized 
	square of plywood. The center of the brass was located and punched. Two circles were 
	marked out at 1.567" and 1.828" diameters. The block of material was placed on a 
	centered rotary table in the mill. The block was adjusted to center using the 
	slip-on-spud. It was clamped in place with two strap clamps. Two round blocks were 
	used as stops around one marked corner. The photo shows the setup.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC drilling setup.jpg" alt="The setup for drilling the forty-five holes" width="2123" height="2276"">

<p>
	The table was offset on the y-axis 0.7835". A 1/16" drill was used to drill holes 
	every 8&deg; around the circle. The holes were drilled through the brass and aluminum 
	and into the wood underlayment. The forty-five holes were drilled in fifty-two 
	minutes. The following photo shows the completed forty-five holes. They are not 
	perfectly aligned with the marked circle.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC 45 holes.jpg" alt="The forty-five holes drilled" width="1584" height="1541"">

<p>
	The initial plan changed. The table was moved 1/16": spindle toward the center. A 
	1/8" drill drilled a hole through to the wood. The drill was switched for a 1/8" end 
	mill. The end mill was advanced in 0.02-0.03" increments and a circle cut through the 
	brass, aluminum and into the wood. The brass circle was removed when it was cut free. 
	At this point the aluminum was removed.
</p>

<p>
	The hole needs to be at least 3/8" deep for the slotting tool to get through the 
	brass and deeper to get through the aluminum. An attempt was made to use a chisel 
	to remove wood in the center. This was not very effective. The block was moved to 
	the four-jaw chuck on the lathe. It was drilled up to 3/8" and then bored out to the 
	groove cut with the end mill. The photo below shows the completed boring operation.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC block bored.jpg" alt="The block drilled and bored" width="1745" height="1975"">

<p>
	The block was returned to the rotary table using the two stops for centering with the 
	marked corner between them. Almost two months later I am returning to this project. 
	The mill table has had the rotary set up on it this entire time, so I have not had 
	access to the mill. The shaper was used in its stead for the 
	<a href="QCTP base plate">QCTP base plate</a>. Fighting off the effects of the two 
	vaccines received yesterday, flu and covid. Not sure I will get much done.
</p>

<p>
	After some monkeying around trying to set the part up correctly I decided to at least 
	try out cutting one gap. The tool bit was sharpened and the slotting attachment was 
	installed. The cutter was aligned with one drilled hole and the an attempted cut was 
	made. There was just too much play in the slotting attachment. I would get a good 
	cut and then after moving the table 0.001" I could not get through the brass. This 
	approach was abandoned. I can think of no better path forward than returning to the 
	file.
</p>

<p>
	I am going to try out some very small burrs for the Dremel to cut the gaps between 
	teeth on the inner gear. I need a way to clamp the block securely. I found an old 
	vise that clamps to a table or board. An appropriate "board" was made from scrap, 
	which was clamped in the end vise on the workbench as seen in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC table extension.jpg" alt="Table extension to support the vise" width="1853" height="1565"">

<img class=inline src="images/PC teeth milled.jpg" alt="Teeth in inside gear milled with Dremel" width="1738" height="1955"">

<p>
	The Dremel worked pretty well, giving reasonable gear teeth shaped gaps. The next 
	step was cutting out the circle. The rotary table was recentered and the block 
	centered on the table using the central 3/8" hole. This was a mistake. The larger 
	hole was not concentric with this hole. Cutting was begun and I quickly realized 
	the error. The 1/8" end mill was moved further out and a rough approximation of a 
	circle was cut. The gear was freed from the block. It was filed roughly to shape by 
	hand.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC gear filed.jpg" alt="Internal gear filed somewhat round" width="1466" height="1685"">

<p>
	To fit in the central hole of the middle card the internal gear needs to be cut 
	round. The morning was spent making a mandrel for holding this gear, so it can be 
	cut to size. A 2" round scrap of aluminum was located. One end was cut off and faced 
	to serve as the cap. This plate was held in the lathe and aligned with parallels. It 
	was faced and drilled through with a 24/64" drill. A 0.06" deep well was cut in 
	the face that is wider than the ID of the gear.
</p>

<p>
	The rest of the scrap was placed in the lathe and faced. It was turned down to fit 
	the internal gear to a depth of 0.025". This part was then drilled with an 'O' drill 
	and tapped 3/8-24. The gear fits tightly and the cap sits on top. Unfortunately, I 
	have not been able to find a 3/8-24 screw. The mandrel will remain in the lathe until 
	it is used. I don't want to mess up the concentricity.
</p>

<p>
	Finally made it to Menards to pick up a stainless steel screw. It was installed and found 
	to be too long. A scrap of brass was used as a washer. The internal gear ring was 
	pressed on and the cap screwed tight. The cap and mandrel body were slightly larger 
	than the gear. The mandrel was cut down to size. The gear was slowly reduced in 
	0.005" increments. The cutting was stopped when there was about a 1/2" of flat left 
	on the gear. The gear was removed and placed into the opening in the central card 
	layer. A perfect fit. The first photo shows the setup, the second the partially 
	finished cut, and the third the fit.

<p>
	After a week at Perdido Key with Rhea and my sisters it is time to finish this 
	business card. The next task is cutting the slots in the top of the card. Placing the 
	gears in order to measure slot location, demonstrated that they are too small! The 
	photo below shows the problem. Either the central gear or the planetary gears need to 
	be larger. It is difficult to measure the needed correction, but it is slightly less 
	than 1/16". The gap can be seen between the left planetary gear and the internal 
	gear, as well as between the bottom planetary gear and the central gear.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC gear gap.jpg" alt="The gaps between the gears" width="1554" height="1571"">

<p>
	The table with planned gear dimensions from above is reproduced below with an 
	additional row, measured outer diameter (or inner diameter for the internal gear). 
	The differences between measured and planned are minimal. For the time being I will 
	assume that the problem arises from the internal gear being too large. Unfortunately, 
	these dimensions don't tell me how much bigger the gears need to be cut. The central 
	gear measures 0.500" to 0.505" between teeth. The same planetary gears measurement 
	is 0.405" to 0.410". The tooth depth for the central gear is then (0.632 - 0.502)/2 = 
	0.065". The tooth depth for the planetary gears is (0.532 - 0.408)/2 = 0.062".

<p>
	An estimate is that the central gear needs to be 0.050" larger in diameter. An OD 
	of 0.683" with a diametral pitch of 30 implies 18.5 teeth. Either an OD of 0.667" or 
	0.700" provides 18 or 19 teeth, respectively. The PD for an 18 tooth gear is 0.600". 
	On the other hand remaking the planetary gears requires a 15 tooth gear. Its OD is 
	0.567" and its PD is 0.500". Of course this is doubled and the total PD for the 3 
	gears is 1.567". The overall size of the current 3 gears when fully engaged is 1.537".  
	This is just about the same size as the ID of the internal gear, no wonder there is 
	no overlap! The photo shows the internal, central, and two planetary gears fully 
	engaged. Quite the gap. The gap will easily accomodate 1/16" of increase. Time to 
	make larger planetary gears.

	The table above shows the final specs for the new planetary gears. Five new "squares" 
	of 1/32" brass were cut out with a hacksaw. The squares were approximately 11/16" on 
	a side. The center of each blank was marked as seen in the first photo below. The 
	centers were punched and drilled with a center drill and a #19 drill. Burrs were 
	removed. The blanks were placed on the mandrel and held tight with a nut, second photo 
	below. Part way through reducing the squares to circles the nut came loose. The threads 
	were shot, so the mandrel had to be partly remade.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC square reduction.jpg" alt="The brass blanks being reduced to circles" width="1784" height="1735"">

<p>
	The old screw was cut off of the mandrel with a hacksaw. The end was faced and 3/8" 
	was reduced to 0.165". The end was chamfered and the shaft was threaded 8-32. The 
	shaft end was center drilled for a tailstock center. The squares were returned to 
	this new shaft and two nuts were used to hold the blanks in place. The blanks were 
	turned to circles in increments of 0.005" and then reduced to 0.567" diameter. The 
	lathe chuck was transferred to the Sherline gear cutting attachment on the mill. The 
	spindle was lowered until the 30 DP #7 cutter just touched the top of the blanks.
</p>

<p>
	The spindle was lowered half of the 0.215" thickness of the cutter. Then it was 
	lowered half of the diameter of the blanks, 0.284". The spindle was locked. The 
	cutter was advanced until it touched off on the blanks. A cutting chart was 
	constructed with the LibreOffice template, 
	Documents/Metalworking/Gear Cutting/Gear Cutting Measurements.ods. The gaps need to 
	be cut 0.072" deep.
</p>

<p>
	The teeth were cut with multiple issues along the way. They are not perfect but not
	bad considering. They were removed from the mandrel and separated with gentle 
	hammering. Both sides were filed flat to remove the burrs. They were fit into the 
	internal gear. The fit is tight. The internal gear gaps are probably not deep 
	enough. We are one step closer to completion.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC new fit.jpg" alt="All gears fit into the internal gear" width="1162" height="1175"">

<p>
	The internal gear gaps were deepened using the Dremel equipped with a diamond burr. 
	The teeth were also thinned as needed and straightened with hand filing. The assembly 
	of gears now seems to work, though it is difficult to really test it without a top 
	to hold everything together.
</p>

<p>
	The first attempt was made to cut the observation windows in the top sheet. A center 
	punch was made in this sheet 1" from the end and centered across the 2" dimension. 
	Four circles were scribed at radii: 0.219", 0.490", 0.667", & 0.854". The rotary table 
	was centered on the milling table under the spindle. The brass sheet was taped to a 
	block of similarly sized plywood. This was centered under the spindle using the 
	slip-on-spud. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC window layout.jpg" alt="The delimiting rings layed out on the brass" width="1918" height="1379"">

<p>
	The table was moved 0.219 + 0.0625". The table was rotated to 7&deg;. 
	A hole was drilled with the center drill and then with a 1/8" drill. The drill was 
	switched for a 1/8" end mill. The curve was milled to 52&deg;. This is when I 
	realized I made a mistake. The plan is to cut the curves between the following angles:
	7 - 52&deg;, 67 - 112&deg;, 127 - 172&deg;, 187 - 232&deg;, 247 - 292&deg;, & 307 - 
	352&deg. The rotation needs to start after 7&deg; and stop before 52&deg to keep the 
	cut inside these bounds. I need to do some math to figure out the correct angular 
	bounds of these circles.
</p>

<p class="note">
	The math was simple. The circumference of the smallest circle is 1.769". Half of the 
	diameter of the drill is 3.5% of the circumference. This corresponds to 12.7&deg; for 
	this circle. Consequently, the limiting angles for the first arc are 20&deg; and 
	39&deg;. The other four arcs are limited by the following angle pairs: 80 - 99&deg;, 
	140 - 159&deg;, 200 - 219&deg;, 260 - 279&deg;, & 320 - 339&deg;.
</p>

<p>
	The layout was repeated on a second similarly sized piece of brass. This brass stock 
	was carpet taped to the wooden block and centered under the spindle after recentering 
	the rotary table. The table was set to 0&deg; and locked. The y-axis was shifted 
	0.219 + 0.0625" putting the spindle inside the first line. A hole was drilled with 
	a center drill followed by a 1/8" drill. The drill chuck was switched for a 1/8" 
	end mill. This was lowered past the depth of the 1/32" thick brass stock. The table 
	was turned to 19&deg; while cutting. The end mill was raised and the table turned to 
	60&deg;. The drill chuck was returned to the spindle and a second hole was drilled.
	Back to the end mill and the brass was cut to 79&deg;. This was repeated for the 
	following angles: 120 - 139&deg;, 180 - 199&deg;, 240 - 259&deg;, & 300 - 319&deg;.
</p>

<p>
	The table was at 319&deg;. The rotary table was locked and a slot was cut 0.146" 
	(0.49-.282-.0625) away from the center of the circle. The y-axis was locked, the 
	rotary table unlocked, and an arc was cut back to 300&deg;. After locking the rotary 
	table and unlocking the y-axis the opening was cut back toward center, 0.146". This 
	process was repeated for the remaining five openings. The six openings at this stage 
	are seen in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC first windows.jpg" alt="The first six windows cut into the top of the card" width="1860" height="1989"">

<p>
	The six outside windows will be cut with the same angular limits. The table needs to 
	be moved 0.448" to put the spindle 1/16" outside the third ring. This was done. With 
	the table at 0&deg; the first hole was drilled. This time the full opening was cut 
	before moving on. The table was moved 0.08" between rings. The final six openings 
	are shown below. After a little work with a file the windows were placed over the 
	assembled gears. The revealed gears are seen in the second photo.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PC peeking gears.jpg" alt="The gears seen through the twelve windows" width="1637" height="1888"">

<p>
	Looking back at the original plans, a discrepancy was discovered. The outer openings 
	are narrower than planned. Using the same angular limits for inner and outer was not 
	the correct way to proceed. I can either stick with what I have, open these up, or 
	cut a new top card face.
