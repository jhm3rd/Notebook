<p class=first>
	At long last constructing a four planet orrery is about to begin. This page covers 
	the plan for the orrery as well as some key specifications. An orrery is a scale 
	model of the solar system. There are many types available and they have been 
	constructed for almost 2000 years. The oldest known example is the very complex 
	and still to be completely understood Antikythera Device. The orrery whose 
	construction is discussed herein is a four planet orrery: Sun, Mercury, Venus, 
	Earth, and Mars. It is designed to accurately reflect the relative positions and 
	motions of these planets. It is also a fairly simple example, using a simple gear 
	stack and does not include moving moons of either Earth or Mars. This orrery uses 
	rings holding a planet ‘ball’ to represent the planets in their orbits as opposed to 
	‘balls on wires’ which is another common orrery type.
</p>

<p class=note>
	Thank goodness for the Sun centered solar system. Designing an Earth centered 
	orrery to reproduce the observed motions of the planets would be quite the 
	nightmare.
</p>

<img class=inline src="orOver/Orbital patterns.png" alt="Observed planetary motion" width="2042" height="582">

<p>
	The first challenge in designing an orrery is selecting a scale for the planetary 
	orbits and designing a gear train that will accurately reproduce the relative time 
	required for each planet to circle the sun. Relative in this case means relative to 
	the Earth. Table 1 contains some pertinent facts about the eight currently approved 
	planets. These numbers served as constraints in the design process.
</p>

<p class=note>
	The numbers highlighted are particularly pertinent to this orrery.
</p>

<p>
	This orrery includes only the first four planets. Including Jupiter or other 
	planets challenges the scale required to keep things to a reasonable size. 
	For example, if Earth’s orbit is represented by a 5” ring then Mercury’s ring is 2” 
	and Jupiter would require a 26” ring. Including the outer planets in an orrery 
	requires either very small inner planetary rings or incorrectly representing the 
	orbital scales. Orbital inclination is not represented in this orrery and Mercury's 
	much more elliptical orbit is not represented either. The planetary specifications 
	reproduced relatively and accurately here are: the distance from the sun, the orbital 
	period, and the size of each planet, all relative to the Earth. (The sun’s size is 
	not represented to scale as it is approximately 110 times the size of the Earth. 
	Earth's moon is also represented. It's diameter is 0.27 times the Earth's. Mars's 
	two moons, Phobos and Deimos, are too small (0.002 & 0.001 X) to represent other 
	than with dots.(The planet's sizes relative to their orbital sizes are also not to 
	scale for obvious reasons.) A simplified diagram of the orrery is depicted in Figure 
	1. Of further note is the lack of movement of Earth's moon. Including this movement 
	would have led to a much more ornery orrery.

<p class=note>
	Note Venus's backward planetary axial rotation and almost 180&deg; tilt. 
	i.e. Something must have hit it and knocked it over at some point in its formation 
	similar to Earth's collision with a Mars sized object producing its oversized moon 
	(about 0.27 times the Earth's radius).
</p>

<img class=inline src="orOver/Frames Rings Gears.jpeg" alt="Orrery Skeleton" width="2062" height="1282">

<p>
	Discussion of some of the design considerations is in order. The base, rings, and 
	gears are made of brass. The outermost or Mars ring may require support at its 
	periphery as it is only mounted on the tube through its center. It was envisioned that 
	this support could be provided with minimal friction by placing small steel balls in 
	the upper support below the Mars ring. Initially I planned to use three or four bars 
	as spokes to connect the outer planet holding ring to the inner axle holding ring. 
	After seeing Weston Bye's magnetic clock with its delicate circles connecting the 
	inner and outer rings a change was made. 
</p>

<p>
	Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the tubes which will connect the gears 
	to the planetary rings. The topmost gear is soldered to and will drive the largest 
	or Mars tube, which is affixed to the lowest planetary ring. The next smaller tube 
	is soldered to the next gear down the driven stack and affixed to the Earth ring. 
	Next comes the Venus tube and finally Mercury's tube. The sun will be mounted on a 
	1/8" rod running through the center of the Mercury tube.
</p>

<img class=inline src="orOver/Tubes.jpeg" alt="Planetary Tubes" width="1456" height="1222">

<p>
	The next consideration is the gear train required for driving the motions of the 
	planets. Since this is my first orrery I decided to keep the gear train as simple as 
	possible. Using two gears per planet in a pair of gear stacks seemed to be the 
	simplest solution. The way gear stack pairs work is one stack has all of the gears 
	fixed together so they all rotate in sync. In the second stack the gears are not 
	fixed one to the other and rotate independently at speed ratios set by the number of 
	gear teeth. One question remained: how accurately can the rotational periods be 
	reproduced using only two gears. The two gear stacks are denoted throughout this 
	construction as “driver” and “driven”. The driver stack is the fixed stack and will be 
	turned by a worm, thus all rotating with the same period as the worm wheel. The worm gear 
	and wheel combination is not shown in Figure 1 but will be the driving mechanism when 
	connected to a shaft and handle. The worm gear axle’s handle will sit outside of the 
	main support structure. The driver gear stack consists of the worm wheel and four 
	gears; one for each planet ring. These gears are all fixed relative to one another 
	by attachment to the same shared shaft or as implemented here with a "key". The driven 
	gear stack has four gears, one for each planet ring, and they all rotate independently 
	on the concentric tubes.
</p>

<p>
	The gear train is the source of any accuracy in the representation of the planetary 
	orbital periods. In order to model the various gear ratios possible and how 
	accurately they represent the orbital periods (shown above in Table 1) a spreadsheet 
	was constructed. For all four gear pairs to mesh between the two stacks, the total 
	number of teeth must be the same across each gear pair. The spreadsheet looked at 
	the impact of varying this total versus the accuracy of the resultant orbital period. 
	Over one hundred teeth totals were explored. Two examples from this spreadsheet are 
	given in Table 2. Of all of the possibilities considered these two were the best 
	representations of the orbital periods. Higher accuracy would require more complex 
	gear trains. The 78-tooth set seemed perfectly adequate for my first attempt at 
	building an orrery with an orbital period error of less than 1% relative to Earth’s 
	orbital period. This orrery will not be able to accurately predict relative planetary 
	positions over time spans of centuries! Another limitation to consider when selecting 
	a gear train is the gear size (and corresponding number of teeth). I wanted to keep 
	the number of teeth between 12 and 75 just for practicality. Gears smaller than 12 
	teeth are difficult to make and the larger the gear the longer it takes to make by 
	the methods available in my shop. A total of 78 teeth was the perfect choice.

	The frame presented yet another challenge. It needed to be made from reasonably 
	sturdy brass stock, so I chose 3/16”. Brass is too expensive for me to purchase 
	sufficient stock to cut out two circles (top and bottom) from sheet stock. This meant 
	making the frame from bar stock. For a couple of reasons I chose to make the frame 
	in the shape of a dodecagon (12-sides). First, this would correspond to the months 
	of the year, though not exactly. Secondly, it would be closer to a circle and less 
	noticeably polygonal than an octagon or a decagon. So how does one make a polygon 
	from bar stock? Making some kind of lap joint and either screwing, soldering, or 
	riveting the pieces together is incredibly challenging as it requires angled pockets, 
	difficult to make accurately. That leaves butt joints. These would also need to be cut 
	quite accurately or the accumulation of error as they were joined around the loop 
	would leave one with a poor fit for the closing joint. A few calculations showed that 
	using a sine bar should be sufficiently accurate. Each leg of the dodecahedron would 
	need to have both ends cut to a 15&deg; angle. Assuming a 5” sine bar is used then 
	the vertical displacement is about 1.3”. Consequently, 0.1&deg; is approximately 
	0.009” and 0.01&deg; is about 0.001”. So if my setup is accurate to 0.01&deg;, then 
	the last joint error (assuming maximal error for each leg) is about 0.12 degrees. 
	The butt joints will be soldered so 2-4 thou gaps are left for capillary action at 
	each joint and these gaps should provide allowance for this cumulative error.
</p>

<p>
	Making the worm gear and worm wheel are very similar to turning a screw and creating 
	a regular gear. There are two key features of the worm gear system that are 
	important to the design of the orrery. First, the number of degrees of turn of the 
	wheel upon a full revolution of the worm is fixed by the number of teeth on the 
	wheel. 52 teeth on the wheel gives one 52nd of a full turn per turn of the worm 
	gear’s handle or very close to one week of time. Thus, it will take 52 turns of the 
	handle for the earth to make one complete revolution around the sun. An alternative 
	is using a 26 tooth wheel, so one complete worm revolution is equivalent to two weeks. 
	Second, rotating the worm gear clockwise as seen from a handle will rotate the wheel 
	clockwise if the worm is on the front side of the wheel as seen from above. With the 
	driving gear stack rotating clockwise, the driven gear stack and the planet rings 
	will rotate counterclockwise. The planets rotate around the sun in a counterclockwise 
	direction as seen from above the earth’s north pole, so the worm gear needs to be 
	mounted to the front side of the wheel as seen from above (assuming the shaft handle 
	is on the side of the gear stacks as shown.)
</p>

<p class=note>
	A builder living south of the equator might want to flip this around!
</p>

<img class=inline src="orOver/Worm & gear rotation.jpg" alt="Worm & gear rotation" width="530" height="609">

<p class=note>
	In the picture above the bottom driven gear is shown incorrectly as "driven" by the 
	worm wheel. This is not the case, but it makes the picture a little easier to 
	understand.
</p>

<p>
	Aligning the worm, driven stack and worm shaft brackets took some thought. A depthing 
	tool was made to find the optimum distance between the two gear stacks vs. just 
	using the theoretical 1.300". The worm and wheel separation could not be determined 
	with the depthing tool and trial and error was the alternative. The two brackets 
	spanning the worm gear needed to be far enough apart to avoid the wheel. Finally, 
	these brackets needed to be carefully aligned so the correct worm/wheel distance 
	could be set. The following thought process helped determine the best alignment for 
	all of these moving parts. Since everything is confined to the 2" width of the 
	supporting span, the worm wheel needed to be offset above this center location of 
	the driven gear stack. Setting the wheel about 5/16" above center seemed adequate. 
	The worm-wheel center-to-center distance is about 11/16". The worm is set slightly 
	below center, about 5/16". In order for the two brackets to miss the 26-tooth wheel 
	they need to be set about 1/8" from the end of the worm. Consequently some bronze 
	spacers would need to be made. With the brackets spaced appropriately this left 
	about 7/16" between the end of the bracket and the center of the driven gear. This 
	was plenty of room for the 1/2" diameter spacer at the bottom of the driven gear 
	stack.
</p>

<p>
	A piece of plywood 1/4" X 2" X 8" was chosen to serve the role of the eventual brass 
	supporting span. A center hole was marked. The two earth gears were place on the 
	depthing tool, which was adjusted so the gears meshed nicely. This distance was 
	transferred to the plywood base by marking an arc with the depthing tool. This arc 
	was marked 5/16" above center for the driver gear stack hole. A mark was also made 
	for one hole in the right bracket. Once the worm wheel was in place the worm in the 
	bracket could be rotated to achieve best fit and the other holes marked and drilled. 
</p>

<p>
	The last major design consideration was dealing with setting the planets to their 
	proper positions around the sun in a relative sense and with respect to the 
	zodiacal constellations that I planned as decoration for the frame. In other words a 
	method of planetary ring adjustment needed to be built into the system. After 
	considering a variety of ideas the best seemed to be some means of fixing the rings 
	to the tubes via a rotatable hub. So a hub must be designed that is screwed to the 
	ring and uses a set screw to hold the hub to the planet's tube. The hub design 
	chosen is depicted below. The Radius = 3/16" dimension of the center hole, as shown 
	for the Mars ring hub, needs to be reduced to fit the tubes of the other three 
	planets.
</p>

<img class=inline src="orOver/Ring Hubs.tiff" alt="Ring Hubs" width="530" height="609">

<p>
	Finally, a few thoughts about decorating the orrery are in order. The frame rings 
	are like the heavens above and fixed relative to the solar system. So two things 
	are planned for the frames. They need to show the months and maybe even the weeks 
	of the year. (Days might be overkill.) In addition it would be great to depict the 
	constellations of the zodiac in some form. Using text for months and constellations 
	requires some means of engraving on the brass. Consequently, a course in metal 
	engraving was planned and taken. Engraving would also allow for using the 
	astronomical symbols for the planets and the constellations. Other text can also 
	be imagined that would be appropriate for the planetary rings. The final idea was 
	to not only label the approximate positions of the zodiacal constellations, but to 
	also show the constellations. This could be as simple as drilling holes for each 
	of the stars or filling the holes with a contrasting metal plug or inserting some 
	other material in the hole. Since this orrery is to be a portrayal of reality, the 
	thirteen zodiacal constellations (including Ophiuchus) and their dates of arrival as 
	recognized by astronomers was selected over the usual 12 constellations and dates 
	used by astrologers. The following table displays some key facts about these 13 
	constellations.

	fourmilab</a>. The size of the display can be altered and the view can be set to 
	show only the inner four planets. Other data is available for your specific 
	longitude/latitude.
