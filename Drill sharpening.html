<p class=first>
	For some reason I decided to sharpen drills this morning. In DevonThink I found an 
	article by Harold Hall on sharpening drills. The article was "Sharpening Twist Drills"
	in MEW vol. 141, page 12. It was printed and a copy was stored with the sharpening 
	station. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="drlShrp/Sharpening jig.jpg" alt="Drill sharpening jig" width="2779" height="2107">

<p>
	The sharpening station was from Uncle Bob. After reading the article I set up the 
	jig somewhat randomly and sharpened a drill. The chisel, or center line was at an 
	angle of 90&deg; with respect the two straight cutting edges. This angle is supposed 
	to be 130&deg;. The jig is simple to use. The jig to grinding wheel distance is set. 
	A drill is inserted. The drill is set so that it just touches the wheel. The 
	straight cutting edges are set vertical or aligned with the little pointer. The clamp 
	on the drill is tightened as well as the lock nut for distance adjustments. The screw 
	to tighten the clamp can be see at the very top of the jig. The knurled lock nut is 
	the bottom most nut on the jig's screw.
</p>
	
<p>
	The 
	entire jig is turned back and forth swinging the tip of the drill past the wheel. In 
	the picture that would be a 90&deg; clockwise turn followed by turning back to the 
	starting position seen in the photo.The lock nut is loosened and the clamp is 
	loosened. The drill is moved forward about 1/4 turn of the distance adjustment knob. 
	This is the darker silver nut just above the lock nut. The clamps are retightened 
	making sure the cutting edge remains vertical. Another grinding pass is made. Things 
	are loosened, the drill is rotated 180&deg; so the other cutting edge is vertical. 
	The other face is sharpened.
</p>

<p>
	The key to sharpening is twofold. The first is setting the overall angle of the jig, 
	to match the angle of the twist drill. Nearly all are 118&deg;. There is a setting 
	on the jig for 59&deg; and this was the correct setting for all of the drills 
	sharpened. The second critical factor is the angle of the chisel. As mentioned 
	above the first drill I sharpened was left with a 90&deg; chisel angle relative to 
	the straight cutting edges. This means the drill bit tip is too far away from the 
	center of rotation. The jig was shifted closer to the wheel by loosening the wing nut 
	at the base (far left in picture) and pushing it forward, into the wheel. To get a 
	130&deg; chisel this needs to go in almost as far as possible. The cutting edge 
	pointer was about 1/8" from the grinding wheel. 
</p>

<p>
	A small scrap of aluminum was prepared that has a scratch on it at 130&deg; relative 
	to the sides. It can be held next to a drill to check the chisel angle. It was left 
	with the sharpening jig. (It can be seen just to the right of the wing nut leaning 
	up against the jig.) Once this distance was set it was correct for all drills 
	sharpened. I started with the drills on the drill cabinet. The 1/2" through  
	17/64" drills were all sharpened. Three large drills from the coffee can were also 
	sharpened. The last drill sharpened was a 3/4" drill from a wooden box inside the 
	cabinet that was noted as dull. A bit of oil was put on the sharpened drills to 
	inhibit rusting. Two of the larger drills were not sharpened. These two have the 
	black tips. They had never been used and felt sharp.

<p class="note">
	I do not know how well the jig works on smaller drills. I did not try any smaller 
	than 17/64". I just found an image of the cover of the original instructions. This 
	claims the jig will work for drills from 1/8" to 3/4". I just didn't know how low 
	I could go!
