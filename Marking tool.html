<p class=first>
	I was looking for a small project to tide me over while waiting on one more type of 
	transfer paper for orrery ink transfer. The following was found in my DevonThink 
	database. The pictures came from a discussion group (homeshopmachinist/shop made 
	tools). It is a low profile adjustable marking tool. Rotate the tool to set the 
	marking pin at the desired height and make a scratch on your stock. 
</p>

<p>
	I did not have any brass large enough for the outer base of the tool. I did find a 
	1&nbsp;3/4" length of 1&nbsp;13/8" aluminum hex and a 1" diameter brass rod. The 
	aluminum was chucked in the South Bend 3-jaw chuck. It was faced on both ends. One 
	approach to making this was to offset the through hole for the pin holder. Two small 
	rectangles of 1/8" aluminum were cut and used to displace the hex in the chuck. The 
	total offset is less than 1/8", but I never bothered to determine what it was.
</p>

<p>
	The offset hex was center drilled and then drilled with a 3/8" drill. The hole was 
	opened to 5/8" to use the boring bar. The boring bar needed to be raised about 1/8" 
	above the height of the standard spacer I made for the 3/8" tools. The bar needed to 
	be extended about 2" in order to make it all the way through the part. The boring 
	tool did not cut the aluminum. There was too much chatter from the makeshift holder 
	and/or the long extension. Consequently, the hole was opened to 1" by drilling. The 
	drilling went very smoothly as long as the drill was advanced slowly. Luckily the 
	drills were quite sharp. (Thanks Uncle Bob!) This produced a nice sliding fit for 
	the 1" brass rod.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Rough measurements of the wall thickness of the aluminum part are 0.110" at the 
	base and 0.280" at the top.
</p>

<p>
	The brass rod was cut to length and faced on both ends. The ends were very lightly 
	chamfered. A wide cutting tool (5/32") was used to make the groove in the center of 
	the rod for the set screw. Both parts were deburred and sanded a bit. The center of 
	the groove was measured from the end of the part and this distance was marked on the 
	aluminum. The aluminum was drilled at this distance on center through to the hole 
	with a #16 drill. The hole was tapped 12-24. The picture below shows both parts at 
	this stage.
</p>

<p>
	The screw was tackled next. A 1&nbsp;1/4" length of 1/2" bronze rod was faced and 
	the end was heavily chamfered. It was then knurled for about 1/2". It was reversed 
	in the chuck and held with soft aluminum jaws. The other end was faced and then the 
	diameter was reduced to 0.216" stopping just a bit before the knurling. The length 
	was shortened by facing and the end was chamfered. Threads, 12-24, were cut with the 
	lathe to a depth of 0.023". This provided a decent fit in the tapped outer base.
</p>

<p class="note">
	For some reason the part kept jumping out of the chuck even with reasonably light 
	cuts. This, unfortunately, marred the knurling somewhat.
</p>

<p>
	A 1" length of 1/8" drill rod was faced on one end in a collet and the other end was 
	cut to almost a point with the headstock set at 15&deg;. This pointed end of the pin 
	was heated to cherry red and quenched in motor oil. The hardened pin was held in the 
	cordless drill and sharpened on the sanding belt.
</p>

<p>
	The inner rod was held in the vise with a small v-block. The #0 center drill (0.125" 
	in diameter) was centered behind the part on the x-axis by eye. It was slowly brought 
	up to the part while spinning until it could be heard touching the part. The spindle 
	was raised and then moved toward the center of the part by 0.188". The part was 
	center drilled, drilled 0.116" and reamed 1/8". The hole was lightly deburred. 
</p>

<p>
	The pin was too tight of a fit so it was sanded until it was a sliding fit in the 
	hole. A drop of Loctite was placed in the hole and an attempt was made to insert the 
	pin. No amount of wiggling would allow the air bubble to come out and the pin would 
	not stay all the way in the hole. The pin was returned to the lathe and a very light 
	cut was made on the unhardened end. The pin slid cleanly into the hole and the glue 
	was left to dry. The first photo below shows the two separate parts and the second 
	shows the parts assembled. The lowest it will mark is 1/4".
