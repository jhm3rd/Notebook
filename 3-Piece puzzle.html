	This three piece puzzle was seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zQmkyH0Mr0&amp;t=1s">
	Mr. Puzzle's YouTube channel</a>. A picture of the puzzle as purchased is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-piece puzzle.png" alt="Commercial 3 piece puzzle" width="1320" height="670">

<p>
	The three pieces are identical conjunctions of two square solids with their widths 
	equal to half their heights. There are two magnets in each piece running through the 
	center of each square. The pieces are symmetrical, simplifying things substantially. 
	The plan is to make each piece from a single piece of wood where each square is 
	1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1". Instead of milling away half of the material 
	from a 1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2" block, I will experiment with cutting two 
	pieces from a slightly larger block. This should be doable with some careful sawing. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	One issue yet to be resolved is magnet orientation. In the finished puzzle the 
	aligned magnets need to be attracting. Determining which orientation works will 
	require resolution prior to gluing the magnets in place. Twenty 1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2" 
	rod shaped neodymium magnets were ordered from 
	<a href="https://www.kjmagnetics.com/products.asp?cat=1&amp;scri=16&amp;scri=43">
	K & J Magnetics</a>. I may make more than one puzzle!
</p>

<p>
	I found a nice block of quartersawn wood that can be used to make 3 pieces without 
	overlapping or 6 with. I do not know the type of wood, but the figuring on it is 
	gorgeous. Before I use this wood I will experiment with some less interesting poplar. 
	Two 3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3" blocks of poplar from the joinery class were 
	glued and clamped face-to-face. After letting the glue dry for a few hours the block 
	was cut in half and the two halves were trimmed to 
	1&nbsp;1/4"&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2&nbsp;1/4" on the table saw. The cut lines 
	were carefully laid out on all 6 faces of the first block. These consist of two 
	through cuts centered on each end oriented at 90&deg; relative to one another and two 
	trickier cuts in the middle to separate the parts. Looking at the left most part in 
	the picture above these trickier cuts are down from the top and in from the right. 
	These cuts are tricky because they are stopped cuts: the cuts must stop half-way 
	through.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-piece cut lines.jpg" alt="Cut lines marked on sides" width="1612" height="1786">

<p>
	The cuts were made with the Japanese pull saw. The trickier cuts were opened with the 
	back saw and then with some clamping and blocking the cuts were extended all the way 
	into the hidden corners. After separating the parts I realized that this will not 
	work. As can be seen in the picture below the cut needs to be moved farther to the 
	right of center to allow room on the left side for clean-up. Of course that means 
	the cut on the other part will be off the wrong way. In other words there is no way 
	to make this cut and allow wood for clean-up! Time to start milling or routing.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-piece problem.jpg" alt="Cutting problem highlighted" width="1743" height="1807">

<p>
	Some work with the router indicated the need for a jig. One was simply constructed 
	from 3/4" Baltic Birch plywood scraps. The back of the jig is about 3"&nbsp;X&nbsp;5" 
	and has an L-shaped part attached that will serve as the top hold-down for the piece 
	to be cut as well as an end support. The long leg of this L-shaped jig part is 
	3&nbsp;1/4" long and 1" wide. The short leg is made from a 1" X 1" scrap and is 
	drilled and tapped through center for a 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;20 bolt. Two holes were 
	drilled through and countersunk for a #6&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4" wood screw at the end of 
	the long side of the L. Screws were put through these holes and along with glued 
	attached the two arms of the L. The L was similarly attached to the back with two 
	countersunk #6 screws and glue. A 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" block with a 
	1/4" hole deeply chamfered was use for the push block.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-Piece jig.jpg" alt="Routing jig" width="2088" height="1528">

<p>
	Three 1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2" blocks of poplar were prepared. One was marked 
	for waste removal and placed in the jig. The jig was clamped to the miter gauge. The 
	end of the block was aligned with the 1/2" router bit raised 1/2" above the insert. 
	The screw was screwed in one full turn after marking one edge of the hex head. The 
	block was then clamped to the jig. 0.050" was removed from the end of the block. The 
	block was unclamped, flipped, and the other side was cut. The screw was then moved 
	in two turns (0.100") and the next cut was made on each end. The process was repeated 
	until the remaining wood was about 1/8" thick. The screw was then moved in only one 
	turn and cuts were made on either end. This left only a wafer thin section of wood, 
	which was removed with a knife. Some sanding was done on the block, but sanding the 
	just cut ends only rounds them off. A small 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" block was used as an 
	auxiliary clamping block when more than 1/2" was removed. A second block was cut 
	similarly (about 30 min). 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-Piece routing.jpg" alt="Routing the first piece in the jig" width="2287" height="1652">

<p class="note">
	Attempting to put the two blocks together highlighted the need to further trim the 
	small square faces left from routing. As seen in the following picture a small 
	amount needs to be removed so the parts will fit. The rounding from sanding is also 
	visible on the small faces.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-Piece fit.jpg" alt="Assembling the first two pieces" width="1480" height="1035">

<p>
	After a slight modification of the jig: a piece of wood was screwed to the end to 
	help minimize tearout there is still some "wobble" from cut to cut. The pieces are 
	just not accurately cut. Maybe the mill is the answer. Potentially, using the vise 
	with parallels to raise the part >1/2", a stop on one side of the vise, and  a strap 
	clamp to keep the part from rising out of the vise, I might be able to pull this off 
	with speed and reproducibility. The two remaining poplar blocks are 
	1.990"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1.990"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1.980". A C-clamp was used to hold a parallel
	across the side of the vise serving as the stop. This along with a strap clamp on 
	top held the block rigidly from three directions. The first pass seemed 
	to work very well. The cuts were made 0.100" across and 0.150" deep. The mill was run 
	at a high speed. The depth was stopped at 0.495" and the width at 0.995". The final 
	measurements will be decided once two parts can be assembled. There was no tearout at 
	the back, but the top had what would be called a burr if this were metal, but in 
	wood might be called "tearup"? This was removed by carefully cutting up the face of 
	the cut and then across the top with a sharp knife.
</p>

<p>
	In the picture below you can see the end of the parallel held with the C-clamp that 
	serves as a stop on the left side of the vise. There are two parallels under the 
	wooden part and the backer board continues to the right of the vise. All of the "fur" 
	is also visible on the top edge.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-Piece milling setup.jpg" alt="Setup for milling" width="1822" height="1536">

<p>
	Two poplar parts were made on the mill. The inside corners were gently cleaned with 
	a knife to remove burrs. The image below shows the fit. It is off by < 0.005". Quite 
	nice. Now let's do the same work on three parts made from pretty wood.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-Piece milled.jpg" alt="Two milled parts put together" width="1616" height="1177">

<p>
	The block of wood chosen was only slightly larger than 2" wide so the dimensions for 
	these puzzle pieces needs to be a bit smaller. The block was only about 3&nbsp;1/2" 
	long so two pieces were cut with the grain extending from one end of the piece to the 
	other. The third piece has grain across the narrow width. 
</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Block</th>
		<th>Length</th>
		<th>Figure W</th>
		<th>Grain W</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>1.969-1.985</td>
		<td>0.946-0.953</td>

	</tr>
</table>

<p class="note">
	As the table above shows there is significant variation and lack of square across 
	the three blocks after cutting on the table saw. Block 2 is the block cut across the 
	grain.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of trying to square up the blocks and cut them all to a common size, the plan 
	is to judiciously make the required cuts to minimize the impact of the non-parallel 
	sides. So, for example, on Block 1 the grain width has a narrow end and this will 
	become the width of a newly cut face. In this way the 1/2" height, the important 
	dimension, will be minimally impacted. Some sanding on the ends and sides of the 
	cut pieces will fix any remaining discrepancies. In general I will aim for piece 
	thickness of 0.465" to 0.475". 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-pieces final marked.jpg" alt="Three final blocks marked for milling" width="1834" height="1037">

<p>
	The first two pieces were cut as above. The third was first rough cut with the 
	Japanese saw and then milled to finished size. At one point the wall of the third 
	piece broke off. This was glued and then milling resumed. Had multiple challenges 
	with this piece including tearout in a few places. All three pieces need to have 
	their corners slightly rounded. The lengths of the pieces do not match twice the 
	width so the fit is not ideal. The six widths range from 0.912" to 0.946" with an 
	average of 0.932". To adjust the length each end was to be trimmed about 
	0.025-0.030". The pieces fit much better now.
</p>

<p>
	The two better pieces were sanded on all sides to 150 grit and the edges were all 
	slightly chamfered with a fine file. This produced about 1/32" of bevel. The third 
	piece needed some repair work. A dab of neutral wood putty was mixed about 1:1 with 
	sanding dust. A drop of glue was added to make the mixture workable. This mix was 
	applied to some of the divots in the third piece and left to dry overnight.
</p>

<p>
	The pieces were drilled for the magnets. Twelve 1/8&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/16" cylindrical 
	neodymium magnets were purchased. The holes were drilled on center by width and at 
	0.49" from the edge. A block of scrap wood was placed beneath the pieces during 
	drilling. They were drilled 0.116" and reamed to 1/8". Since the thickness of each 
	of the pieces was different, steel spacers were made to fit between two magnets. 
	The spacers were made from 1/8" drill rod. This was held in a collet in the lathe, 
	faced, chamfered and parted off at the correct length 0.099", 0.088", & etc. It 
	was difficult to put the spacers in the holes without them going in crooked. While 
	attempting to rescue a crooked spacer one of the pieces broke. This was glued and 
	clamped.
</p>

<p class="note">
	The difficulty of dealing with the odd sizes and differences between pieces made me
	rethink the process. Taking another look at Mr. Puzzle's video showed that the 
	puzzle pieces were made from two identical square sections. It also clarified the 
	orientation of the magnets: opposite orientations of the two magnets in each piece.
</p>

<p>
	A new block of interesting wood was found that was better sized for the job. A long 
	1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" blank was cut on the table saw. Seven 1/2" lengths were cut from 
	this blank. These squares were sanded on all faces with 220-grit paper. Unfortunately, 
	they are not square!! 
</p>

<p>
	Yet again a block of wood was procured. This one is about 
	1&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/2". One side was cut off to yield a flat surface. 
	This flat surface was placed on the table and both adjacent sides were cut after 
	ensuring the blade was perpendicular to the table. The second cut was set at 1.0". 
	The block was rotated 90&deg; and the last side was cut at 1.0". The sides of this 
	blank were quite square and pretty accurately sized. The miter gauge was squared up 
	and nine 1/2" slices were cut from the blank using a 1/2" spacer against the fence. 
	The blocks produced ranged in width and depth from 0.990" to 1. 10". They were 
	similarly within 0.01" of 0.500" thick except for one block that is 0.532" thick.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/9-blocks.jpg" alt="Nine blocks cut square" width="1743" height="1716">

<p>
	The thick block was reduced to 0.50" on the milling machine. Using a ruler for a 
	stop the blocks were clamped in the milling vise on a scrap of wood. The edges 
	were located and the table moved in 0.500" in both directions. The blocks were 
	drilled with a small starter drill, a #32 drill, and a reamed 0.125". They were 
	then sanded on all faces with 220 grit paper and a fine file was used to chamfer
	all sixteen edges of each of the nine blocks. The best six were selected for use. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-Piece clamping jig.jpg" alt="Clamping jig to glue up the pieces" width="1537" height="1356">

<p>
	A small clamping jig was made and two of the non-selected blocks were glued and 
	clamped in the jig (photo above). The jig was slightly less than 2" in width so the 
	clamps would seat easily on the blocks. As the glue was drying on this trial piece tung 
	oil finish was explored on a block of the same wood. Both a side and one end of the 
	wood were sanded with 150 grit paper and coated with tung oil. This coat was kept 
	"shiny" for 3 minutes before wiping off the excess. It was then allowed to dry 
	overnight. The tung oil procedure for unstained wood shown below is from Popular 
	Woodworking Vol. 156, pg 79 was used on this test block.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sand the wood to remove machine marks and other flaws.</li>
	<li>Wipe or brush on a wet coat of oil and keep the surface wet for several minutes, 
		rewetting any areas that become dull because the finish has soaked in.</li>
	<li>Wipe off all the excess.</li>
	<li>Allow the finish to dry overnight in a warm room.</li>
	<li>Wipe or brush on a second coat of oil and sand the surface while it’s still wet 
		in the direction of the grain using #600-grit wet/dry sandpaper. Sand over all 
		areas with three or four back-and-forth strokes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I  was not thrilled with the tung oil result. It seemed as though the tung oil had 
	still not filled the pores after three coats. The finish was smooth, but was not the 
	least shiny. Shellac was used on two other faces of the scrap block and gave a nice 
	finish after three coats. The best eight blocks were glued up with the jig as above 
	to make four pieces. These pieces were sanded with 300 grit paper in the areas where 
	squeeze out had occurred. The 1/2" magnets arrived and were inserted using the 
	workbench vise and blocks of wood. A small drop of Loctite was used in each hole. 
	The first coat of shellac was applied to one half of each block as seen in the 
	following picture.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/3-Piece with magnets.jpg" alt="Magnets installed and first shellac on" width="1826" height="1426">

<p>
	Three coats of shellac later the pieces looked great! Assembly failed! Some of the 
	magnets were not put in correctly. A quick trip to the lathe and a 5/8" long piece 
	of 1/2" hex steel was converted into a small punch with a diameter of 0.120". This 
	and a small wooden cylinder with a hole through it were used to press out one 
	magnet in two pieces. The magnets were turned around, reinserted and pressed into 
	place. No glue was used as the fit was quite tight. The picture below shows the 
	completed and assembled 3-piece puzzle.
