<p class=first>
	Our grandfather clock has been missing a finial for the thirty plus years since we got 
	it from my grandmother. I recently had a clock repairman out to get the clock 
	running. I decided it was time to make a finial. As the photo shows there will be a 
	full moon tonight.
</p>

<p>
	I am not sure what kind of wood was used for the clock. I believe it is maple, so 
	a nominal 3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;4" maple board was purchased at Menards. The shortest 
	available was 6', so I will have a little extra. An 8&nbsp;1/2" length was cut off 
	with the circular saw and split down the middle on the table saw. The two halves 
	were glued face-to-face. 
</p>

<p>
	A finial design was found on the internet that looked appropriate. A rough sketch 
	was drawn based on proportions from the internet example. The size of the drawing 
	seemed appropriate so the proportions became measurements as shown on the right side. 
	The diameter of the finial at various spots is shown on the left side. The plan is 
	to cut it to approximate size on the lathe and then rasp/sand to the final profile. 
	The overall height of the final finial will be about 5". The base the finial will 
	rest on is 1&nbsp;7/8" square.
</p>

<p>
	The glued up block was held in the four jaw chuck on the South Bend lathe. It was 
	center drilled and supported with a live tailstock center. The block was turned 
	round for most of it length. This left a 1&nbsp;1/2" cylinder. This was marked with 
	a pencil at places of transition in the plan. A 1/8" wide cutoff tool was used to 
	reduce the diameter where needed. This was followed by a rasp, file and sandpaper up 
	to 320 grit. There are no photos of intermediate stages of lathe work.
</p>

<p>
	The square end was sawed off. The bottom was sanded. It was very difficult to sand it 
	flat and perpendicular to its axis! The top cylinder was also sawed off and the new 
	end was sanded round.
</p>

<p>
	The base was center marked, punched, drilled, and tapped for an 8-32 screw. A stain 
	to match the clock was needed. Holding the G&G table next to the clock showed the 
	G&G was significantly more orange than the clock. A scrap of the maple was stained 
	with the medium brown stain that was used to make up the G&G stain. When held next 
	to the clock this looked too brown. A solution of one part orange to two parts brown 
	was made and applied to the scrap. This looked like a close match. More was made up 
	and painted on the finial, which is shown drying below.

<p>
	The stained finial seemed too dark so it was lightly sanded with 320 grit paper. 
	Speckling was next. Black spray paint was sprayed into a small container. A 
	toothbrush was dipped in the paint and the bristles scraped with a gloved finger. 
	The web recommendation suggested using a screen. I found the screen worthless. After 
	making sure the bulk of the paint was off of the brush it did a good job of scattering 
	random drops of black on the finial. The picture below shows the result.

<p>
	The first coat of water based semi-gloss varnish was applied this afternoon. After 
	two hours or so the next coat will be applied. A bit of sanding will be done between 
	coats. The finial already looks pretty good. After three coats the finial was 
	installed this afternoon.
