<p class=first>
	Michelle asked that I make a <a href="littlefreelibrary.org">Little Free Library</a> 
	for their new yard. After looking around for some time and exploring multiple 
	alternatives, I decided to make a dodecahedron for the library and decorate it with 
	a math theme.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Dodecahedron.gif" alt="Dodecahedron" width="256" height="256">

<p>
	The dodecahedron will sit with a point on top and on bottom. This allows for a 
	better position for the door. This will pose somewhat of a problem for attaching 
	the library to the post. A cradle that fits the point will need to be made. The 
	point is a vertex where three pentagons join. Making a cradle to fit this should 
	be relatively straightforward.  
</p>

<p>
	Decorations for the dodecahedron will consist of various mathematically interesting 
	pictures. The dodecahedron will be painted in four colors: the four color theorem. 
	One side will feature the other four Platonic solids. There will be multiple 
	visual proofs: 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...  = 1, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1), 1 + 3 + 
	5 + ... + 2n-1 = n<sup>2</sup>, 1/4 + 2/8 + 3/16 + 4/32 + ... = 1, 2nd proof that 
	1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...  = 1. A number of visual proofs of the Pythagorean theorem are 
	possibilities. A rotating proof of the Pythagorean theorem will also be attempted. 
	It should be signed and dated on a bottom face. Euler's formula for the relationship 
	of the number of edges, vertices, and faces, E + F - V = 2, should be included.
</p>

<p>
	A dodecahedron is made of twelve regular pentagons. Some key mathematical parameters 
	follow: 
	
	<ul>
		<li>12 faces, 20 edges, 30 vertices</li>
		<li>area of a pentagon = 1.72 s<sup>2</sup></li>
		<li>pentagon diagonal = &phi; s</li>
		<li>the face-to-face height of the dodecahedron:</li>
	<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'>

	</ul>
	
	Consequently, a pentagon with a side length 
	of 1 foot leads to a door opening of about 1.6', big enough for most books.
</p> 

<p>
	The wikipedia article on pentagons shows the most efficient tiling of the plane 
	with pentagons, columns of pentagons shifted slightly relatively to one another. 
	Consequently, 6 pentagons of side length 1' can be cut from a 4' X 4' sheet. 
	Menards will ship a 4 X 8 sheet of Baltic Birch plywood to the store for about $60. 
</p>

<p>
	In order to be sure that this most efficient tiling will fit in a 4' X 4' square a 
	set of six pentagons were made out of card stock with 1" long sides. These were fit 
	into a 4" X 4" square on graph paper. The pentagons did not fit, the three pentagons 
	across the width were about 2.4" too large. In addition it would be very difficult 
	to cut these pentagons out even if the sides were shortened to 11". The picture 
	below shows this tiling on the 4' square.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Tiling.jpg" alt="Tiling" width="2530" height="2486">

<p>
	An alternate tiling is an improvement in some respects. The pentagons can be cut 
	out with the table saw. However, the tiling only puts 5 pentagons in the 4' square. 
	This tiling is shown in the picture below. This implies 2 - 4' X 8' sheets of 
	Baltic Birch plywood will need to be ordered from Menards. This was done and the 
	plywood arrived today (2/15). Sandy was kind enough to share her truck for the 
	pickup. When picked up it was wrapped in plastic and seemed to be at least 4 sheets 
	thick. When unwrapped at home it became clear that Menards had packed the Baltic 
	Birch plywood surrounded by some cheap sheets of plywood. Thus the source of the 
	$13 shipping and handling charge. The wood came without damage even though we drove 
	home in the rain.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Tiling II.jpg" alt="Alternate tiling" width="2461" height="2461">

<p>
	Cutting out the pentagons will be followed by mitering the edges to 58.29&deg;. 
	Since butt joints are not very strong cutting a dado the length of the mitered 
	edge and using a "spline" to strengthen the joint seems like a reasonable path. The 
	dadoes should not be cut on center but shifted toward the "thicker" edge: the 
	edge that is on the smaller side. The splines should be about 1/4 X 1/2 to fit 
	in the two 1/4 X 1/4 dadoes. One concern was how to fit the pentagons together 
	and whether the splines would make this impossible. Clearly, a pentagon can be 
	added to the Vee of two pentagons with the splines in place. A spline on the third 
	side will need to be added after. Similarly for the fourth spline. Just as obvious 
	is that placing the last pentagon in place must be done without splines, but since 
	this will be the door, there should be little problem.
</p>

<p class=note>
	Take care as the sides of the five pentagons ringing the door opening should not 
	be cut for splines!
</p>

<p class=note>
	Some thought will need to be given to how to avoid splitting the veneer on the 
	edges of the pentagons. Either a 80 tooth blade needs to be used or the cut line 
	will need to be taped.
</p>

<p>
	The first step is to map the layout of pentagons on the plywood received yesterday. 
	The radius of the circumcircle (R) is related to the side length (S) by S/1.176 = R. 
	(Wikipedia.org/wiki/pentagon) Consequently, with a side length of 1.00' the radius 
	of the circumcircle is 0.851'. The large drafting compass was set to 0.851' (10.212") 
	and a circle was drawn. With the compass set to 1.00' the vertices of the pentagon 
	were lightly marked. The final gap between marks was about 5/32", so the length was 
	increased about 1/32" and the vertices were remarked.
</p>

<p class=note>
	The pentagon seems <em>HUGE</em>!! The diameter (vertex to vertex) of the 
	dodecahedron will be about 2'10". The following table (all measurements in inches) 
	was used to compare various dimensions.
</p>

	When asking Rhea about the size as judged by a pentagon with a 12" side, she 
	suggested that I make a prototype from the scrap plywood that came with the 
	Baltic Birch and use duct tape to hold the sides together.
</p>

<p>
	The morning was spent cutting out the pentagons. The first task was laying them 
	out on the 4 X 8 sheet of plywood. Similar to the pentagon with the 12" side drawn 
	above a second pentagon with 10" sides was drawn. This was cut out and used as the 
	template. The pentagons were laid out in a "loose" maximum tiling pattern as seen 
	in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Prototype tiling.jpg" alt="Prototype tiling" width="3024" height="4032">

<p>
	The pentagons were then cut out with the circular saw. (No splitting at the edges 
	was seen!) This tiling pattern will not work beyond this prototype as a number of 
	plunge cuts were needed to separate the pentagons. It took about two hours to cut 
	out the pentagons on the floor of the garage. They are displayed in this photo.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Proto pentagons.jpg" alt="Prototype pentagons" width="2737" height="2433">

<p>
	After lunch the pentagons were taped together. Duct tape was tried first, but it 
	did not stick sufficiently well to the wood to be of use. I found some "aluminum 
	tape" (??) that was used by Ryan and I when we installed the subwoofer in Kevin's 
	car. This sticks much better to the plywood, though it has to be cut and a backing 
	removed before use. The pentagons were taped together with two pieces of tape spanning 
	each edge except for the last pentagon which was held on with only two pieces of 
	tape as it is the door. A few pictures of the completed prototype are shown below. 
	It appears to be the perfect size!
</p>

<p>
	A new pentagon tamplate was cut from poster board and used to lay out 12 pentagons 
	on a sheet of Baltic birch plywood. They were laid out in rows of three, leaving 
	about 2 feet of plywood unused. The rows were cut free with the circular saw. The 
	Baltic birch was laying on a sheet of 1/2" plywood, so there was little tear-out 
	on the bottom, but the top had a lot of tear-out. Little of this impacted the 
	pentagons.
</p>
 
<p>
	Setting up a jig for cutting out the pentagons to the line was challenging. Two 
	clamps were used to hold the plywood to the cross-cutting sled. One had to be 
	mounted on the back of the sled where there is significant flex. It was also too 
	far from the plywood on occasion. A square was mounted to the table at the height 
	of the top of the plywood. This square was aligned with the blade and clamped in 
	place. The line on each side of the pentagon to be cut was aligned with this 
	square and the plywood was clamped to the cross-sled. A 150 tooth blade was used 
	for cutting and gave minimal tear-out. The picture below probably provides a better 
	description. With all of the difficulties each side was cut to within 1/32" of the 
	line. All sides will be recut at an angle.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Pentagon cut jig.jpg" alt="Pentagon cutting jig" width="2461" height="2071">
<img class=inline src="images/Pentagons.jpg" alt="All pentagons" width="2664" height="2946">

<p>
	All of the pentagons have been cut. A jig for precisely cutting the angles needs to 
	be designed. The jig under consideration is a modification of the cross-cutting sled. 
	Essentially a Vee needs to be attached with the internal angle of the Vee equal to 
	that of the pentagons, 108&deg;. The distance from the point of the Vee to the edge 
	of the sled next to the blade should place the side to be cut at the blade. This is 
	not critical as long as it is the same from pentagon to pentagon. More critical is 
	the angle of this Vee with respect to the edge of the sled. A perpendicular that 
	goes through the angle of the Vee should accurately bisect that angle. If the Vee 
	is not accurately aligned the pentagons will not fit well and may need significant 
	modification. One way to ensure the angle is bisected is using a square and measuring 
	the distances instead of measuring the angles with a protractor.
</p>

<p>
	An 18" X 28" section of Baltic Birch was cut from what was left after making the 
	pentagons. The 150 tooth blade was exchanged for the dado set at 3/4". The long 
	square side of this stock was aligned with the front of the table saw and the side 
	at right angles was used to align the fence at 5 3/8" from the center of the dado 
	stack. A 3/8" deep dado was then cut in the stock perpendicular to the back edge 
	and centered 5 3/8" from the right edge. An old oak towel rod was about 3/4" square 
	in cross section. This was thinned by about 1/32" prior to putting in the dado stack 
	and was a nice sliding fit in the dado. This bar was secured in the dado with four 
	#10 wood screws. A piece of plywood about 3" X 24" was glued to the back edge of the 
	Baltic Birch. The dado blade set was replaced with the 150 tooth blade and the blade 
	was angled to 58.3&deg; This was done by cutting out a poster board triangle with 
	this angle. The sides of the triangle measured 5.25(6)", 8.50(7)", and 10.00(0)". 
	The blade was aligned as well as could be done with a light behind the blade/paper. 
	A further check with the level app on the phone showed a 31.7&deg; angle on the back 
	side of the blade. The leading edge of the base was then cut at this angle. This 
	required significant force to cut and there was a lot of burning. The cuts on the 
	edges of the pentagons may have to be made to 1/2 of the required depth at a time! 
	The two brackets providing the pentagons angle were positioned by aligning them 
	with a pentagon. They were each screwed to the base with two #10 screws. The clamps 
	were then attached with #8 screws.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Dodec angle jig.jpg" alt="Dodecagon angle jig" width="2669" height="2629">

<p>
	The first pentagon was cut at 1/2 depth all the way around followed by cutting to 
	full depth. This was repeated on a second pentagon. The two pentagons when placed 
	together on their beveled edges gave a 116.5&deg; angle as best as I could measure. 
	There was significant burning even at half depth! This needs to be ameliorated 
	before any more are cut. The blade was cleaned tooth by tooth with a dental pick. 
	This removed all of the buildup on the blade. Cutting with the cleaned blade was 
	not much better. Then tried 1/4" deep cuts (vertical height of blade over jig), but 
	this was no better so went back to 3/8" cuts. Went out and purchased a new blade, 
	180 teeth thin kerf. Was no better than the old blade!!! Got them all cut while Rhea 
	was out. When Rhea returned she ran the kitchen exhaust fan and opened a window to 
	remove the smoke smell.
</p>

<p>
	With all of the angled sides cut on the pentagons it was time to set up for the dado 
	to be cut in most of these edges. Before any cutting one pentagon was set aside 
	for the door and five pentagons were marked with one side to have no dado. These 
	sides will line the door opening. The blade was already set at the correct angle. 
	(I proved to myself that standing the pentagon on its edge while cutting would 
	produce a dado that is at right angles to the face of the angled cut.) The fence 
	was set on the opposite blade side from usual and a featherboard was set up on the 
	opposite side of the blade on a 3/4" block of wood. The fence was moved so the cut 
	was about 1/8" from inside edge of the angled cut. The blade was also raised so the 
	cut was about 1/4" deep. All of the edges were dadoed on six pentagons and five of 
	the edges were cut on five of the pentagons, leaving the door opening uncut. 
</p>

<p>
	Some 1/8" stock was found and cut to 8 1/2" lengths. The depth of the two cuts when 
	joined was slightly less than 1/2", so this material was cut off in 7/16" widths. 
	Approximately 30 splines were made. Six pentagons were then dry assembled to test 
	the overall plan. Success as you can see from the pictures below!
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Dry assem 1.jpg" alt="Dry assembly 1" width="2427" height="1833">
<img class=inline src="images/Dry assem 2.jpg" alt="Dry assembly 2" width="3024" height="3062">

<p class=note>
	Notice the well toasted pentagon edges. Ah, the sweet smell of burned Baltic birch 
	throughout the house. Even the dadoes were difficult cuts with the regular and 
	sharp carbide tipped blade, but there was no burning.
</p>

<p>
	Two part epoxy was used to glue the sides together. A liberal amount was spread on 
	a spline and it was inserted into a dado. Epoxy was then spread on both faces of the 
	joint and on the protruding part of the spline and the sides were attached. As more 
	sides were attached epoxy was also spread on faces to be joined in this first set. 
	It was necessary, but quite difficult to get the first six sides together and bound 
	with a strap clamp. The bottom six sides were left to dry overnight. There was quite 
	a bit of glue runout in some places, so carefully planned support is needed. A bit 
	of light could also be seen through some of the corners. These will need to be 
	sealed. This was at least partially accomplished by spreading epoxy along the gaps 
	on the inside of the dodecahedron as it exists so far. This seemed to do a nice job 
	of filling the gaps. Will do the same on the inside of the remainder when finished 
	as well as on the outside. 
</p>

<p>
	The final five sides were glued on next. They all went on smoothly including the 
	last which required mating the side to two splines before sliding home the last two 
	splines. One joint required clamping. This was accomplished by clamping C clamps 
	on either side of the joint and clamping the C clamps together with a bar clamp. The 
	photo below shows the dodecahedron with all sides glued. Epoxy was spread along the 
	joints to fill any gaps both inside and out. This was done over multiple days as 
	only top edges could be filled due to the thin nature of the epoxy.
 </p>

<p>
	A section of Lexan plastic that was about 1/8" thick was cut in the approximate 
	shape of a pentagon with the sabre saw using a fine tooth blade. The cut went well. 
	Unfortunately, peeling the paper off left hardened glue, that could not be scraped 
	off, nor would acetone dissolve it without etching the plastic. Meanwhile, 
	the back of the door was marked for a pentagonal hole two inches from each side. 
	Holes (5/16") were drilled 3/16" from each side in the corners. The sabre saw with 
	a Bosch blade was used to cut the pentagon out. This went well with only a little 
	off-line wander. The outside edges were rounded off with sand paper. A sheet of 1/4" 
	acrylic plastic was purchased at Menard's and cut to the approximate shape of a 
	pentagon. This plastic cutting had more problems with melting probably because it 
	was thicker. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Dodecahedron door.jpg" alt="Dodecahedron door" width="2403" height="2578">

<p>
	The plastic was glued to the back of the door with a thin layer of epoxy 
	and was held in place with 9-10 clamps. It was easy to see the clamps squeeze out 
	the air bubbles in the epoxy. Made sure there was a little glue on the front inside 
	edges squeezed out to provide a good water seal.
</p>

<p>
	Spray paint was purchased at Menard's. Rustoleum Painter's Touch 2X was selected. 
	Primer and four gloss colors were chosen. The colors are called spa blue, warm yellow, 
	coral, and ivory. Using the web color selectors were not directly useful, but 
	helped me focus on fewer choices.
</p>

<p>
	The base was a challenge to plan. Essentially it needs to consist of a 16" square 
	with an equilateral triangle cutout. The triangle must have sloped sides to fit a 
	point of the dodecahedron. When the dodecahedron rests on a point the door is 
	positioned most like a regular door. A piece of the Baltic birch remained from 
	cutting out the pentagons so parts were laid out on it. Three rectangles were cut 
	8" wide in lengths of 18 1/4", 19 1/16", and 19 7/8". These were then cut in half 
	on the sled used above with the blade set at 32.25&deg; and the wood held at a 
	30&deg; angle. These form two sides of the triangle and will be stacked so that 
	the angled sides will align to form a continuous slope. The third sides of the 
	triangle were also cut from rectangles (16" X 4 9/32", 5 3/32", and 5 29/32") by 
	mitering the long side at 32.25&deg; and mitering the short sides again with the 
	wood held at a 30&deg; angle.The miters on the long sides were on opposite faces 
	relative to the miters on the short sides. Two of these rectangles were too short 
	as there was insufficient wood. These pieces were cut in half. The pieces were 
	glued to form the stack with space between them so the mitered ends were aligned. 
	The pieces were then glued together face-to-face to form the three layer thick 
	stack. Two small rectangles of plywood were cut to fit the gaps after gluing up 
	the stack. The sides of these stacks were cut to length on two opposite ends. 
	The end  with the two long pieces aligned in the middle was faced with a rectangle 
	(2 1/4" X 16") of plywood (screwed and glued). The screws were countersunk and the 
	holes were plugged with plugs cut from a 3/8" dowel rod. 
</p>

<p class=note>
	The lengths of the mirror image sides cut from the same rectangle were very poorly 
	selected. The cut line needs to be adjusted in one direction or the other about 3/8" 
	or so, but for the life of me I could not figure out how to do this, so the lengths 
	varied substantially. Thus the "cutting to length" above.

	While gluing up the base the dodecahedron was sanded. Before sanding the larger globs 
	of hardened epoxy were carefully removed with a chisel. Sanding by hand was attempted 
	first. It was very slow and not very productive even with a coarse grit of paper. 
	The orbital sander with 100 grit paper was tried next and this quickly removed the 
	excess epoxy and left a smooth finish on the faces of the dodecahedron. Many gaps 
	were filled with multiple layers of glue. This was also the case with the base.

	Once the base was completed it was set on a 5 gallon bucket and the dodecahedron was 
	placed on it. The marked hinge side of the door was aligned appropriately. Then the 
	shelf and supports were planned. With the planned supports sitting "vertically" as 
	judged by perpendicularity with the top edge of their respective pentagons the angle 
	was measured as 52&deg;. With a right triangle cut with one angle of 52&deg; the top 
	was not level as determined with the aid of the cell phone app, iHandy Level. In 
	order for the top to be level it needed to be cut at a 32&deg; angle. When this was 
	done the level was reasonably close (about 3&deg; off). Both of the supports were 
	secured with carpet tape about 4 1/2" in from the nearest edge and 1 1/2" up from 
	the bottom join of the pentagon. At this point a rectangular board was placed on 
	the supports temporarily as a shelf. The shelf only contacted one edge of each 
	support. Consequently the top edge of each support needed to be angled. Again the 
	level app indicated 
	a 21&deg; miter was needed. This miter was cut on the tops of both supports. With 
	this done the temporary shelf was reasonably level in all directions and it sat 
	firmly on the the supports. The shelf was planned to reasonably match the sides of 
	the dodecahedron. The backing from a note pad was placed on the supports and the 
	sides bent up to approximate the angles of the sides of the dodecahedron. Once these 
	angles were fairly close the backing was cut with a razor. A few measurements were 
	taken and the semi-hexagonal shape was marked out on a 1/2" oak faced plywood board. 
	This was cut and it fit well on the supports. The supports were marked for two screws 
	each and through holes (1/8") were drilled perpendicular to the face of the support 
	against the wall of the dodecahedron. Putting the supports back in place a transfer 
	punch was used to mark the sides of the dodecahedron. Screw holes were drilled about 
	1/2" deep.  The holes in the supports were countersunk as deep as needed so 1/2" of 
	the 1 1/4" screw would protrude when fully driven into the support. The supports were 
	then attached. A pencil was broken in half and used to mark the outlines of the 
	supports on the bottom of the shelf. The shelf was drilled through and a punch was 
	used to mark the supports. The supports were drilled and the shelf holes were 
	countersunk for the heads of the screws. Installing the shelf temporarily allowed me 
	to test the entire package as seen in the picture below. 
</p>

<p>
	The dodecahedron was attached to the base with six 1 1/2" wood screws. The best 
	orientation for the dodecahedron relative to the base was located and can be seen 
	in the picture below. The edge of the base that has the attached strip is just to 
	the right of the door. The distance from the edge of the door opening to the base 
	on the outside is 10 7/8" and with a drop of 3/8" along the miter, the corresponding 
	distance on the inside is 10 1/2". Similar measurements for the other two sides of 
	the triangular opening were the same. Holes for the six screws were located 1" below 
	this distance and about 1 3/4" in from the sides of the pentagons. They were drilled 
	using a wood screw drill adapter perpendicular to the face being drilled. The screws 
	were installed with wax on their threads. Flipped the dodecahedron over. <em>Low and 
	behold,</em> the faces of the dodecahedron do not match the miters cut on the base! 
	Not surprising considering all of the trouble these angles have provided.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Dodecahedron orientation.jpg" alt="Dodecahedron orientation on base" width="2028" height="2686">

<p>
	The angle that should have been used for these miters is the angle spanned by 
	one face and one edge instead of the angle spanned by two faces. Consequently, there 
	is a large gap between the dodecahedron and the mitered inside edge of the base of 
	19&deg;. The screws were installed above span this gap. It is not clear how deeply 
	they penetrate the base, but probably not enough for comfort. [Interestingly, the 
	gap was noticed while drilling.] The plan for remediating this error is to make six 
	wedges to span this gap and provide additional purchase for the screws. The wedges 
	will be glued to the bottom of the dodecahedron and drilled for the longer screws (2"). 
	Holding the wood while cutting on the table saw at the correct angle presents some 
	challenges. The wedges may all need to be cut from the end of a long board. Cutting 
	some of the sides by hand is another possibility. The two shorter sides of the 
	wedges need to be cut to 1 3/8" and 2 1/4". The angles at the corners of the wedges 
	are 19&deg;, 122&deg; and 39&deg;. One wedge was made by hand to test the angles 
	and it fit well. The other five were laid out on a 5" wide plywood board. They were 
	aligned with the miter so the table saw could be used for the cuts. After cutting 
	them out They were tested and labelled 1-6 as was the base. They were glued over 
	the previously drilled holes with Tite Bond III. After drying overnight through 
	holes were drilled through the wedges. The holes in the base were drilled about 
	1/4" deeper. All of the screws went right into place, so the 2" brass screws were 
	screwed in with some wax on the threads.
</p>

<p>
	Made one final pass with the epoxy to seal all remaining gaps in both the 
	dodecahedron and in the base. After drying for a few days a final sanding was done 
	with 150 grit paper in the hand sander. All four parts were cleaned with a vacuum 
	brush to remove dust [after fixing the vacuum which was blowing out most of what 
	went in]. It is now ready for priming whenever the temperature gets consistently 
	over 50&deg;.
</p>

<p>
	About a week later and an early April day is supposed to stay consistently over 
	50&deg;. Used three cans of the Rusteoleum Painter's Touch primer to coat the 
	dodecahedron, shelf and base. Need to purchase one more can of primer to finish 
	door and touch-up a few spots with stuck newsprint.
</p>

<p>
	I have been considering various possibilities for sealing the door from water 
	penetration. This is especially important at the top of the door as water draining 
	down from the top could easily enter any gap between the door and the top two 
	pentagons. I have decided to try using some guttering aluminum sheet that I have 
	on hand. What is required are four strips about 1" X 12" (or wider if they are to 
	be bent double to minimize sharp edges). These would be bent along their length at 
	116&deg; to cover the joins between the pentagons and mitered at the ends to fit 
	the pentagonal door. The fifth side of the door will be covered by a "living hinge". 
	The aluminum that overlaps with the pentagons around the door will have some sort 
	of moisture barrier glued on. The moisture barrier will make it more difficult to 
	close the door, so a good closing mechanism will need to be designed.
</p>

<p>
	Two inch wide strips of aluminum were cut from the stock with snips and cut to 12". 
	About 1/4 - 3/8" was left hanging over the edge of the table saw and using a square 
	was held in place with four clamps. Using a block of wood this strip was hammered 
	to a 90&deg; angle. The resulting right angle was held by the wide side in the vise 
	and gently hammered again with the use of a block of wood to less than 90&deg;. On 
	the table saw this was hammered flat via the use of a wooden block. This was 
	repeated on the other long edge producing a 1" wide strip with two edges folded over. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Flashing folding.jpg" alt="Folding the flashing edges" width="2571" height="1174">

<p>
	The flashing with the two folded edges was then returned to the edge of the table 
	saw and clamped with the center line along the edge using the square as before. The 
	flashing was bent along the centerline to approximately 116&deg; with a hammer and 
	a wooden block. This was repeated on the other three strips of aluminum. The final 
	strip of flashing is shown below.
</p>

<p class=note>
	They actually look reasonably professional considering they were not done with the 
	aid of a sheet metal brake! Now let's see if we can cut the correct miters on the 
	ends.
</p>

<p>
	The miter that is on the face of the door should be 1/2 of 108&deg; or 54&deg;.

	The miter angle that will rest on the face of an adjacent pentagon is not so 
	obvious and will be determined empirically. Setting a length of flashing on the 
	dodecahedron and using a straightedge to mark the angle gave 72&deg;. Marking 
	this from the end of the flashing also marks the spot where the 54&deg; angle 
	should be cut from the bend. One end of each of the four lengths of flashing 
	were cut at the required angles. They fit well on the dodecahedron.
</p>

<p>
	The plan is to temporarily attach the flashing to the door with brass screws. It 
	will be removed for painting, painted separately and then reattached. At that time 
	the weather stripping will be glued to the flashing. The "living hinge" will be 
	treated the same way.
</p>

<p class=note>
	Attempted a "continuous" length of flashing across two edges of the door. Made a 
	22" length of the bent flashing and cut out a wedge in the middle of one side 
	with 54&deg; angles forming both sides. Bent this to bring the two edges together. 
	A test fit showed the error of my ways!! This final bend does not give the right 
	angle for the angle across the two faces.
</p>

<p>
	Warmed up enough for some painting today, April 11. Did a little sanding on spots 
	where the grain was raised.Touched up the outside of the dodecahedron with primer 
	as well as the base. Then painted the inside and the shelf with gloss white. The 
	door was taped and painted with primer front and back.
</p>

<p>
	The outside color painting needs to be planned. This must include the base which 
	needs to be a different color than the bottom three faces. The colors are basically 
	orange (O), blue (B), yellow (Y), and tan (T). The door will be one of these colors 
	as well. A first attempt is shown below. The labels in red are for faces in the 
	back and the blue labels are for faces in the front. The door is blue and the face 
	directly behind the door is orange. With the bottom faces orange, tan, and blue, 
	the base must be yellow. There are three blue faces, three yellow faces, three tan 
	faces, three orange faces, and the yellow base. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Dodecahedron color plan.jpg" alt="Dodecahedron" width="580" height="558">

<p>
	Taped up all but the three faces to be painted yellow. The door was also taped along 
	the edges and a pentagonal sheet of card board was taped across the opening. The 
	three faces were sprayed yellow as well as the base. Approximately 30 minutes later a 
	second coat of yellow was sprayed on.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Dodecahedron taped.jpg" alt="Dodecahedron taped for painting" width="1784" height="1737">

<p class=note>
	While painting the second face, brown gunk came out of the can!!! This face was
	sanded back to primer after drying and then repainted yellow before moving on 
	to other colors.
</p>

<p>
	I am giving the yellow and ensuing colors 48 hours of drying time before tackling 
	the next color. Insufficient drying time may allow taping to remove the earlier 
	paint. Unfortunately, the painting will require an additional 9 days of warm 
	weather, which has been scarce. Orange was next. It only took about 1 hour to 
	cover the yellow faces, open the orange faces, and paint them. The tan faces were 
	next. After two more days of drying the tan faces were covered and the soon to be 
	blue faces were uncovered. The blue paint will go on tomorrow, April 27th. Blue is 
	on!! Can't wait to take all of the tape/paper off and see all of the colors together.
</p>

<p>
	A 12" living hinge was ordered this evening. It should be here by May 4th. In the 
	meantime the flashing needs to be installed and painted. I plan to paint it blue 
	where it overlaps the blue door and tan/yellow/orange where it overlaps the adjacent 
	faces. Not yet sure how or if the hinge can be painted.
</p>

<p>
	The tape and paper covering most of the dodecahedron were removed this morning, 
	April 29. Looks very nice, except the tan faces are too similar to the yellow, at 
	least in the light available in the garage. These three faces might need to be 
	repainted a different color. The paint only came off with the tape in one small 
	place on the bottom tan face.
</p>

<p class=note>
	 After cleaning up I was finally able to move the car back into the garage.
</p>

<p>
	After giving it some thought the ivory had to go. It was too bland and too close in 
	color to the yellow. A green paint was purchased and after retaping (!!) sprayed 
	onto the three ivory faces. Three coats were applied over 1 hour. Unveiling 
	will have to wait a further 48 hours. Yet another issue! Some of the green got on a 
	blue face and on a yellow. The blue face was quickly repaired as I had blue paint 
	on hand. The yellow had to be purchased. 
</p>

<p>
	There is no matching yellow to be found. It is not even available directly from 
	Rustoleum. It must have been discontinued. Consequently, all three yellow faces 
	need to be repainted with a new flavor of yellow. Started this today, May 8.
</p>

<p>
	Completed the retaping and painting, waited about 36 hours and removed the wrap. The 
	library looks great! Found a trace of yellow on a green face and easily repainted 
	the overspray.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Dodecahedron painting complete.jpg" alt="Dodecahedron final paint job" width="1588" height="2073">

<p>
	In case water ever gets into the library a hole was drilled in the bottom. A 3/4" 
	Forstner bit was used. The hole was located about 1/4" from the two faces at the 
	very bottom of the dodecahedron. After drilling it was covered with a 1 /14" X 
	1 1/4" square of screen from a repair kit. The screen was stapled in place after a 
	little white primer in the hole.
</p>

<p>
	After attaching the dodecahedron to the base with stainless steel screws and 
	installing the shelf attention turned to hanging the door. The door did not seat 
	properly, so some glue and paint was removed from two corners of the opening with 
	a razor blade. The living hinge was marked and carefully cut on the table saw. Using 
	a punch to mark the holes for drilling cracked the hinge at one end. The other holes 
	were drilled for a 1/2" 6-32 wood screw, four to a side. The cracked end was glued 
	with epoxy and gently clamped in the vise. The glue needs to dry for 48 hours prior 
	to drilling and installing
</p>

<p>
	In the meantime the flashing was selected for three sides of the door: top left, 
	top right and right sides. They were labeled and cut to fit the door with tin snips. 
	These three pieces of flashing were taped and the door side of each was painted 
	blue. After two days the tape was removed and the blue side was taped. The exposed 
	sides were painted to match the face color they would be covering.
</p>

<p class=note>
	It is getting down to the wire! We leave on March 24th for Tulsa. Michelle has been 
	asking about the library. As of March 13 there are still a number of things to 
	complete. The door needs to be drilled for both the hinge and the flashing so both 
	can be installed. The door needs to be drilled for the handle and both it and the 
	bracket need to be installed. Finally, the post needs to be purchased, cut to size, 
	and the supports need to be drilled and temporarily attached to both post and to 
	the dodecahedron.
</p>

<p>
	Hung the door on the living hinge this morning. Four holes were drilled in the side 
	and four in the door. Round head (1/2") brass screws were used. The biggest gaps are 
	at the top two junctures with faces. (Of course!!) When the door was opened it sagged 
	significantly! Back to the drawing board. Two types of hinges were purchased: a 
	piano hinge and two regular 3" long hinges. The piano hinge is 12" long and will 
	need to be cut to fit. This will leave two unplated ends. The pin seems to be made 
	out of steel. Rusting could be a major problem. Consequently the two 3" hinges will 
	be mounted. Hopefully they will cover the holes from the living hinge, otherwise 
	repairs will need to be made.
</p>

<p>
	In the meantime an 8' length of 4" X 4" cedar was purchased. Three feet were cut off 
	leaving 5' for the post. The post is to be buried 2' deep. The door bottom is about 9" 
	above the bottom of the dodecahedron base, so a 5' post will put the door at 3' 9". 
	This may be too tall, but a decision on height will be made in Tulsa. The post can 
	either be shortened or buried a little deeper to decrease the door height.
</p>

<p>
	The 3' length of cedar was cut into sections with 45&deg; angle cuts. The long side 
	of each of these four sections was 7 1/2". These support arms were located so that 
	their top sides were 1.5" above the top of the post. This is because the bottom 
	point of the dodecahedron protrudes through the hole in the base by about 1". The 
	four supports were marked (R, L, F, & B) and were also marked for the two screws 
	holding them to the post. A line was marked across the post at the same level as 
	the screw line to allow easy alignment. Two holes were countersunk (3/8" diameter) 
	and then drilled through for the screws. Screws were pushed into the holes and used 
	to mark the post for drilling. The post was drilled (9/64"). Similarly, the supports 
	were also countersunk and drilled through for attachment to the base. 
</p>

<p class=note>
	As one might expect the 45&deg; angle cuts made with the circular saw were not very 
	accurate. Shims will need to be purchased so the dodecahedron can be leveled, when 
	attached to the support arms.
</p>

<p>
	The hinges purchased for the door were not useful. The holes were too close to the 
	hinge pin. This would force the screws to go through the thinnest part of the face 
	and the door unless they were angled. A new set of all brass hinges were purchased. 
	These have holes at an appropriate distance from the hinge pin and are a little 
	fancier looking. All eight holes were filled with wood putty. These will need to dry 
	overnight prior to sanding and repainting.
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="Dodec door handle.html">handle</a> was already looking tarnished 
	after only a few weeks since cutting. Simichrome polish was used to buff up the 
	handle and other parts that will be outside the door. It is supposed to contain 
	a finish that will resist tarnish. After a few days in the garage I will determine 
	whether these parts need a coat of Spar varnish.
</p>

<p>
	Tackled the door this morning. The new hinges were aligned on the face to the left 
	of the door about 2.5" from the top and bottom edges. The holes were marked and then 
	drilled for the 1/2" screws that came with the hinges. The hinges were put in place 
	as was the door. Holes were then transferred from the hinges to the door. These 
	were drilled and the door was hung. The flashing was attached by drilling through 
	holes close to the edges again about 2.5" from the ends. The holes were transferred 
	to the door and the flashing was screwed to the door with round head brass screws. 
</p>	

<img class=inline src="images/Door in place.jpg" alt="Dodecahedron door in place" width="2682" height="2826">

<p>
	The hole for the handle was drilled with a 3/8" Forstner bit. Unfortunately, there 
	was significant tear out on the front side as the measurements were from the back 
	(1 1/8" from the edge). This was filled with wood putty and allowed to dry overnight. 
	The face with the living hinge holes was sanded, taped and repainted. It needed a 
	second coat of paint after some sanding to remove a line formed by painting against 
	tape. The door required a second layer of putty to completely fill the tear out. The 
	puttied parts of the door were repainted "Spa Blue". In addition two places in the 
	door frame were repainted, since they had been scraped with a razor blade to give a 
	better fit to the door. 
</p>

<p>
	The door was mounted on the morning of May 19th only five days before we leave for 
	Tulsa. The door handle was installed prior to mounting. The slot in the catch 
	was filed at an angle to match the angle of the door latch. The handle latch was 
	used to mark the inside of the right hand dodecahedron face for the catch. Using 
	this mark the catch was attached just inside the door opening using carpet tape. 
	The fit was checked and both the catch and the latch were adjusted slightly. Holes 
	were then started through the catch with a drill. The catch was removed and the 
	holes finished to depth. The catch was installed and the mechanism worked well. A 
	length of weather stripping was temporarily placed behind one of the flashings. It 
	does a nice job of sealing off the gap.
</p>

<p>
	A dedication plaque was tackled while the door work was ongoing. A 4 1/8" X 2 5/8" 
	piece of 1/16" brass was cut with a hacksaw, cleaned up in the mill, sanded (220 to 
	1500 grit), and polished (green polish on a cotton wheel) to a reasonable shine. The 
	corners were also filed to a 45&deg; angle. Four holes will need to be drilled for 
	nails/screws to affix the plate to the top of the door (maybe?). (The bottom of the 
	door will have the Little Free Library plaque.)
</p>

<p class=note>
	Cleaning up the edges of the brass in the mill was challenging. For the long edge 
	that was cut with a hacksaw it was clamped vertically on the angle plate with 
	machinist's clamps. The top edge was cut with a 3/8" end mill. There was tremendous 
	chatter, so it was not cut to the line, but just until it was cleaned up all the way 
	across. Clamping the plate on 1-2-3 blocks (two strap clamps through holes in the 
	blocks) with minimal overhang and cutting with the side of the end mill reduced 
	chatter substantially for the short end. 
</p>

<p class=note>
	The new pulley was installed on the drill press and some effort was made to level the 
	new pulley with the large pulley on which the vee belt was wound. The drill press is 
	now significantly quieter. It was not a bad spindle after all!
</p>

<p>
	The following will be engraved on the dedication plate in

	China white was rubbed on the plate with a little saliva. The lines for the text 
	were marked out. About 1/8" was left for the top and bottom margins. Lines for the text 
	were laid out 3/8" high with a gap of 3/32" between each line. The lower case text 
	was sized at 2/3 of upper case or 1/4". After sketching out the text on paper some 
	adjustments were made in the content. The line width was measured from the paper 
	draft and marked on the plaque. The letters were then sketched in with pencil on 
	the china white. This process took about 2 1/2 hours. A picture of this layout is 
	shown below.

	A 2 1/2" X 5" block of 3/4" plywood was found. After a bit of cleanup one side was 
	covered with carpet tape. The brass plate was pressed onto the carpet tape. The text 
	shown above was engraved on the brass. The only modifications from the picture above 
	were typing the first "love" with the "l" in lower case and shrinking the "2018" to 
	the height of lower case letters. The plaque was then sanded again with 320, 600, & 
	1500 grit paper. Did not polish it this time so as to not get anything in the 
	letters. Holes (#29 drill: the screw was .135" diameter) were drilled in the corners 
	for round head brass wood screws. The brass was cleaned up a final time and then 
	sprayed with Rustoleum Painter's Touch clear gloss. The door handle parts were 
	sprayed at the same time. Hopefully, this will minimize tarnishing for some time.
</p>

<p>
	Well it is the Tuesday before we leave Thursday morning. Today is the day for 
	completion. The first and simplest chore was attaching the plaque. This was put on 
	the back or face opposite the door. Four holes were marked and drilled. The round 
	head brass screws were used. Next was making a stop for the handle. This was fairly 
	easy. A 1/4" brass rod was cut to about 1 3/4" and the ends were chamfered. Threads 
	were cut on one end (1/4-28). A through hole was drilled through the plastic window 
	and the hole into the wood was threaded for about 1/4". The stop was screwed in.

	Attaching the post to the library base was quite the nightmare. First cutting the 
	supports at 45&deg; with a circular saw was not very successful. The best that 
	could be done was moving two opposite supports up close to the base and leaving the 
	other two supports about 1/4-3/8" off. All of the supports were at some angle to 
	the base and not flat. Holes were countersunk for the 2" stainless screws and through
	drilled for the screws. Holes on the base were marked and then drilled for the 
	threaded part of the screws. This required multiple attach/unattach sequences to 
	complete all eight screws. Meanwhile keeping the post at the correct angle relative 
	to the base with the dodecahedron wobbling on a bucket, was next to impossible. In 
	the end it was completed and shims were inserted into the gaps. I think the base 
	is pretty well aligned relative to the post.

	The end of one of the flashings needed to be trimmed as it had been cut with the 
	expectation of flashing along the bottom of the door, which was not needed. The 
	weather stripping was then installed on the inside edges of the flashing. The 
	weather stripping was installed in one continuous length to minimize water entry 
	at the corners. The door shut reasonably well and the latch seemed to do a good 
	job of pulling the door tight around the weather stripping. The only area of 
	concern is the end just above the hinged side. It seems to catch upon closing. All 
	of this work was done while the dodecahedron was laying on its side. Consequently, 
	the door when opened would swing far enough to hit the adjacent face if not opened 
	carefully. So a chain was installed to keep the door from opening too far. I am not 
	sure the chain is strong enough to perform this job, so I may look for a better 
	length of chain.

	I did not yet add the "decorations" that were planned for the post supports. Five 
	brass blade holders from a replaced ceiling fan were saved. These might look nice 
	screwed to the outward faces of the supports. They will at least hide some of the 
	attachment holes/screws. Attached these this morning. They could not be mounted on 
	the supports because the angle left the tops out of alignment. Four were mounted 
	on the post sides with #10-1 1/4" brass wood screws. All that is left is loading 
	it in the car, driving to Tulsa, and planting it in the ground!
