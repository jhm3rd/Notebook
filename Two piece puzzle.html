	The Sweta Cross puzzle was featured on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXEinV3mPT4">
	Mr. Puzzle</a>. It seems simple to make so I will give it a shot. I just happen to 
	have a block of 3/4" aluminum. The solution requires a little manual dexterity and 
	some spinning. A little polishing and it should look really nice. The two main parts 
	are made from 3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3" blocks of aluminum. A rough 
	sketch of the aluminum parts is shown below next a photo of the original.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Sweta cross.png" alt="Sweta Cross puzzle" width="569" height="694">
<img class=inline src="images/TP plan.jpg" alt="Sweta Cross puzzle plan" width="1656" height="1072">

<p>
	Two blocks slightly oversize were cut from the 3/4&nbsp;X&nbsp;3" blank with the 
	band saw. The saw cut ends were cleaned up on the South Bend using a 4-jaw chuck. The 
	two blocks at this stage are shown below.
</p>

<p>
	Four rods need to be made. These lock the parts together and hold the ball bearings. 
	A 12" length of 1/2" brass hex was held in the three jaw chuck in the South Bend. The 
	end was faced and drilled 5/32" to a 5/8" depth. The diameter was reduced to 0.430", 
	to be a loose sliding fit in the 7/16" holes drilled in the aluminum. The rods were 
	parted off at 63/64".
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/TP parts.jpg" alt="Sweta Cross puzzle blocks and rods" width="1697" height="1943">

<p class="note">
	Notice the large nipples left on the rods. The parting tool was fit to the "red" 
	washer on the lantern tool post. I must not have noticed that the blade does not 
	come up to the same level as the top of the tool! It is about 3/64" shy. I found two 
	washers that when put under the parting tool lift it closer, thus the remaining 
	nipple. I will need to make a new washer for this tool.
</p>

<p>
	The rods were held in a collet and the nipples were faced off. The blocks were then 
	marked out for the slot and holes. The slot was cut first. The two blocks were held 
	in the vise. A 5/32" end mill was used to cut the slot. The end mill could only cut 
	1/4" deep before the slot had to be widened. The first photo below shows the cut in 
	progress. The stepped vee was opened with a four flute 3/8" end mill. The end mill 
	was worked over to the side and then lowered in 0.025" increments. As the amount of 
	material increased in width the increments were lowered to 0.015". The second photo 
	shows this in progress.
</p>

<p>
	This was completed on both sides. The depth was carefully increased to half of the 
	total height of the parts. The width was opened so a test block was a tight fit. The 
	parts were sanded on the large sides with the belt sander. It was too tight a fit, 
	so another 0.005" was removed from one side of the slot. This gave a nice sliding 
	fit. The two photos below show the groove and the fit.
</p>

<p class="note">
	There is definitely something wrong with the mill table. As this end mill enters the 
	work it will shift the work to the side by as much as 0.05". Entering the work from 
	the opposite direction produces an equal but opposite shift.
</p>

<p>
	The holes marked out previously were prick punched and then punched with the auto 
	punch. They were started in the mill after clamping the two parts together with a 
	C-clamp. They were drilled with a center, 3/16", 1/4", and 5/16" drills. They were 
	transferred to a drill press vise and drilled with 3/8" and 7/16" drills. The 7/16" 
	drill was drilled 1&nbsp;1/4" deep into the adjoining block. After deburring the 
	parts were almost complete.
</p>

<p>
	The windows were made next. A leftover 1/8" thick acrylic sheet from the dodecahedron 
	library was utilized. A 3/4" strip was cut from this sheet with a saber saw, while it 
	was backed with a piece of plywood. The plastic cut well and left pretty smooth 
	edges. The strip was cut into six 5/8" rectangles with a handsaw and a bench block. 
	The edges were filed smooth. An attempt was made to sand one piece. It was sanded to 
	2000 grit. Even this fine sand paper left a slightly cloudy finish. The other five 
	pieces were just polished on a cloth wheel with the blue rouge. The picture below 
	shows the result. The cloudy window is the middle one on the left side. The edges of 
	the plastic pieces were sanded with the disk sander to give approximately 
	5/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4" pieces.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/TP windows.jpg" alt="The acrylic windows" width="914" height="989">

<p>
	The blocks were clamped together and clamped to the milling table with step clamps. 
	The edge of the block was located with the 3/8" end mill. The table was advanced 
	0.563". A 1/8" deep groove was cut in five passes across both blocks. The groove was 
	widened in 0.020" increments in one direction and then in the other. The grooves 
	were widened to fit the plastic pieces that were 0.617", 0.624", 0.625", and 0.631" 
	wide. The blocks were flipped and the same operation was performed on the opposite 
	end. The first photo shows the milling setup and the second the plastic windows in 
	place.

<img class=inline src="images/TP windows in.jpg" alt="The acrylic windows in place" width="1394" height="918">

<p>
	The blocks were sanded. Some faces needed 400 grit while others were sanded at 1000 
	grit. After all faces were sanded up to 1000 grit, the blocks were polished with 
	white rouge on the aluminum wheel. The blocks were washed with soap and warm water. 
	The resulting blocks can be seen below. All that remains is assembly and gluing the 
	windows in place. The ball bearings have been ordered.
</p>

<p class="note">
	The rods and ball bearings need to be put in before gluing the windows!!!
</p>

<p>
	The puzzle was completed this morning. The bearings arrived yesterday. The shafts and 
	the plastic covers all had to be matched with their specific hole. Three bearings 
	were put into a shaft and the shaft loaded into its hole. Two component epoxy was 
	smeared onto the aluminum with a toothpick. The plastic cover was put in place. The 
	first cover was difficult to keep in place. When its opposite partner was glued in 
	place both were held with a clamp. The same process was repeated on the second part. 
	Its covers were held in place with a rubber band. The final glue up is seen below 
	along with the completed Swiss Cross.

<p>
	Spent a little time online seeking some decoration to engrave on the puzzle. I finally 
	settled on a few simple scrolls. I also put my initials on the back.
</p>

<p>
	I attempted to open the puzzle and was unable to get it to work. All of the pins are 
	out to the plastic, but the two pieces don't come apart. Time to investigate and 
	may need to remove plastic to shorten one or more of the pins.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Not the right place to put this note, but it is too short for a full page. Cutting 
	some steel of unknown origin completely dulled the blade on the bandsaw. A new 
	bandsaw blade was purchased. The manual was somewhat helpful as the blade was changed. 
	It was quite difficult removing the old blade. The new blade (5'&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.025" 
	10/14V Irwin Bimetal Bandsaw Blade from MSC Direct) was installed. Some time 
	was spent aligning the bearings to ensure the blade was vertical. All eight of the 
	oil fixtures was topped off with oil. The bandsaw blade tension was set per the 
	manual. A test cut was made on a piece of 1" steel round bar. The picture below 
	doesn't do justice to the perfect cut! The finish was smooth and the disc thickness 
	varied by &plusmn;0.010"!!
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Bandsaw blade cut.jpg" alt="The newly installed bandsaw blade test cut" width="1515" height="1401">

<p>
	I was able to determine which of the four pins was the culprit by shining a light 
	behind each of the four gaps between the two parts. The pin highlighted does seem to 
	have more cruft between it and the plastic plate. On closer inspection it can be seen 
	that this cruft prevents the pin from touching the plastic plate. I am not sure of 
	the best way to remove the plate from the aluminum. It is a good fit on the sides 
	and the top and bottom of the plate are covered by the aluminum. I will attempt to 
	break it loose by tapping on the side of the plate.
</p>

<p>
	The puzzle was held in the vise with aluminum soft jaws. The plate was easily removed 
	by tapping with a center punch. See the picture below. There was glue practically 
	everywhere. Glue was on the inside rim of the hole, on the face of the pin, and on 
	the face of the plastic. The glue on the metal was carefully scraped away. The face 
	of the pin was sanded to 2000 grit and then polished. The face of the plastic was also 
	sanded to 2000 grit and polished with blue rouge. Epoxy was made up and applied very 
	sparingly to the face of the aluminum with most concentrated on the sides of the 
	slot. The plastic plate was inserted into the slot after inserting the pin and the 
	three ball bearings. It was allowed to dry for 24 hours.

<p class="note">
	The 2-part epoxy may be going bad. The clear material was very thick. It looked like 
	it had started to crystalize on the sides of the bottle. It came out more like jelly 
	than a thick liquid. It loosened up when the hardener was mixed in. Time to purchase 
	more T-88 epoxy from Rockler or Woodcraft.
</p>

<p>
	It is the first day of fall. The harvest moon was shining through the skylight last 
	night at 1:00 am when I awoke with a migraine. But more importantly the puzzle works 
	like a champ!
