<p class=first>
	I took a course on making bandsaw puzzle boxes taught by 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJHVQCu4Ze0">Jeff Vollmer</a>. The course 
	was at Marc Adams School of Woodworking last week. Great course that taught me how 
	to use a bandsaw. Would love to own one. A number of bandsaws were utilized, but the 
	best by far was the P&eacute;gas 14" bandsaw. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="bndswBx/Pegas bandsaw.jpg" alt="Pegas bandsaw" width="512" height="512">

<p>
	Many boxes were made. The first three were what I call 'key and slide' puzzles. A 
	vertical key is cut, followed by cutting a horizontal sliding piece. The nicest 
	box made uses magnets to hide two boxes. It is two levels and has curved drawers 
	in both levels. The two hidden drawers are behind a large semi-circular drawer. A 
	different type of hidden drawer was also made. The drawer can be seen, but needs 
	another piece removed, pulling out a pin allowing a spring to push the drawer out.
</p>

<p>
	This short write-up is solely for documenting what I am doing to finish the boxes. 
	Two boxes were roughly sanded by Jeff. I went over the outsides and flat areas with 
	320-grit paper. The accessible insides were sanded with 120-grit paper. All edges 
	including inside corners were lightly rounded.
</p>

<p>
	Two colors of Danish Oil were purchased. One quart is neutral and one is dark walnut. 
	The two were mixed and poured into a tub that previously housed clamps and string. 
	All of the parts were placed in the oil and let sit for at least a minute. For the 
	larger parts some sloshing and flipping was necessary. The parts were placed on 
	the triangular supports. The parts sat for twenty minutes and were wiped down with 
	shop towels. They were allowed to dry overnight. The puzzle box in back is made 
	from cherry, while the other is made of white oak. The cherry took up a lot of color, 
	but the oak took up very little.
</p>

<p>
	The next step in class is spray varnishing. When Jeff sprays with a power sprayer, 
	he uses three coats. When using a spray can, he uses eleven coats! He says the 
	varnish is so diluted in the can that many more coats are needed. The final step is 
	flocking the interior. This is important to hide the rough drawer insides and to 
	hide the hidden drawers. I am still debating whether to flock or not. It is messy 
	and the glue needs to dry at least two days or the flock rubs off.
</p>

<p>
	The spraying began with the spring box.  Some of the parts were hung in a shroud of 
	plastic sheet. Others were set on the floor using wood scrap with a triangular 
	cross-section. Watco clear lacquer was sprayed on lightly at 8:50 a.m. The lacquer 
	requires 2 hours between coats! Eleven coats will take twenty-two hours of watching 
	paint dry. Got six coats on yesterday.
</p>

<p>
	The final five coats were applied today. They don't seem to be as thickly painted as 
	the box painted by Jeff with the sprayer. I found three parts that I missed painting. 
	Two were the ends of keys and one was the top of a slide. These were combined with 
	the two-layer box for painting this morning. After four coats of paint the second 
	can ran out. Back to Menards tomorrow.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Made an executive decision and switched to brush on lacquer. I needed at least four 
	cans at $14 each. Instead I purchased a quart and a small brush. It is supposed to 
	go on without leaving brush strokes. It requires two hours and no sanding between 
	coats like the spray.
</p>

<p>
	The lacquer was painted on the spring loaded box. It came out nice. As a result the 
	two "King's Safe" boxes were brought up. They were fine sanded with the white 3M pad. 
	One box was done at a time. All of the parts needing lacquer were given two coats. 
	Two seems to be sufficient, giving the boxes a hard glossy coat. The photo shows the 
	two boxes lacquered. There is one more box that still requires woodworking. The boxes 
	need to be flocked.
</p>

<p>
	The last puzzle box needs a major repair. The last picture below of this box shows 
	the drawer which was incorrectly cut. The front needs to be removed and a bottom must 
	be constructed. The bottom can be made from a 1/8" scrap of wood. It will not be 
	seen once it has been flocked. The challenge is cutting off the front of the drawer. 
	The sides can be cut with a saw. Cutting off the bottom may be possible using a 
	circular blade in the Dremel. Keeping the Dremel orthogonal to the drawer in two 
	planes presents a challenge. Ideally the cut will be made just above the glue line.
</p>

<p>
	The Dremel approach worked well. The Dremel was held in the holder made almost four 
	years ago. Orthogonality was not an issue. The saw blade is very tiny and probably 
	burned as much as it cut. The a cut was made all the way through except for the 
	outside corners. These were easily cut with an Xacto knife. The Xacto knife was also 
	used to remove the remainder of the front still glued to the bottom of the box. The 
	cut off front was sanded flat. The picture below shows the removed front. Now a 
	bottom needs to be made.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bndswBx/PB front off.jpg" alt="The front removed from the last box" width="1719" height="1761">

<p>
	In order to make a 1/8" thick bottom the table saw must be used. My table saw is now 
	covered with a large sheet of MDF used for finishing up some parquetry work. Things 
	are never simple in a tiny work shop. The table saw was set up and a slice of a 
	board was cut off. The slice is about 1/8" thick. After a bit of sanding the bottom 
	was glued to the sides and the front. This is shown in the following photo.
</p>

<p>
	The drawer's top edges were sanded until they sat below the edges of the container. 
	When it slid easily with the top part held on sanding was done. The entire box was 
	sanded and corners rounded on the belt sander. All surfaces were then sanded with 
	120 and 220 grit paper. The drawer container was glued to the top of this assembly. 
	The divider was glued into this top assembly.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bndswBx/PB drawer assembly glued.jpg" alt="The drawer assembly glued" width="1708" height="1641">

<p>
	The drawer front needed work as the bottom was only roughly fitted. Excess wood was 
	cut off with a saw. A rasp was used to get rid of most of the rest of the bottom 
	edges. The front was then sanded with 80, 120, and 220 grit paper. The completely 
	sanded drawer front is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bndswBx/PB sanded front.jpg" alt="The drawer assembly glued" width="1581" height="1402">

<p>
	Another issue was discovered. The insert when placed inside the box sat too low by 
	almost 3/16". This is shown in the photo below. The insert rests on supports sitting 
	on the bottom. These supports needed to be made taller. A thin strip of wood was cut 
	from some oak scrap. This was cut to length and then sanded to match the profile of 
	the current supports. Both of these support extensions were clamped in place with 
	glue.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bndswBx/PB too low.jpg" alt="The drawer assembly sits too low" width="1865" height="1749">

<p>
	The parts were soaked in a combination of natural and dark walnut Danish oil for 
	five minutes. The larger parts were turned over every minute. The parts were removed 
	from the bath and stood at an angle to drain most of the oil. After ten minutes the 
	parts were wiped of excess oil and left to dry. The instructions on the Danish oil 
	recommend 72 hours before adding a "finish like polyurethane". I will wait until 
	Saturday afternoon before painting with the lacquer.
</p>

<p>
	Three days later the puzzle box was coated with the first coat of lacquer. The 
	lacquer was brushed on in the basement as the garage was only 50&deg;. Two and a 
	half hours later the box was lightly sanded with #0000 steel wool. Oddly some of 
	the surfaces had white marks, almost an efflorescence. I will try to find out what 
	this means before proceeding.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bndswBx/PB white marks.jpg" alt="White marks on the box after first coat of lacquer" width="1774" height="1749">

<p>
	Some lacquer thinner was painted on the affected surfaces. This was sanded off. After 
	drying the same surfaces were repainted with lacquer. We will see what it looks like 
	after drying. That seemed to work. A second coat of lacquer was applied. The box is 
	seen below. Hints of the white bleed through can still be seen.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bndswBx/PB fixed.jpg" alt="The box after fixing the white marks" width="1934" height="1816">

<p>
	All of the boxes are ready for flocking. There are no more excuses to put this 
	flocking step off. A large cardboard box was taped open and a large leaf bag was held 
	open inside with tape. I purchased two colors of flock: wine and royal blue. I wanted to 
	flock a box for Rhea with royal blue, her favorite color. The glue comes in matching 
	colors. I opened the royal blue glue only to find that it is brown!!! I switched to 
	wine colored flock and its matching glue.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bndswBx/PB brown glue.jpg" alt="The brown glue that was supposed to be blue" width="1934" height="1816">

<p>
	A few parts were done at a time. The parts all needed to have had one coat of finish 
	on the areas to be flocked. The Danish oil soak served that purpose. A very small 
	brush was used to paint glue on the inside of all of the drawers and in a few 
	strategic spots to hide hidden compartments. The few parts were then flocked using 
	the cardboard tube blower. It was fairly straightforward and took about two hours to 
	completely flock all parts for five boxes. All of the parts were inspected to make 
	sure sufficient flock had been applied. The parts are supposed to sit for 7-8 hours 
	before dumping out the excess flock. They should sit for as long as an additional 
	week to ensure the glue is completely dry.
