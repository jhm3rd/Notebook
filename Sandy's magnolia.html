<p class=first>
	My youngest sister Erin reminded me that my sister Sandy turns seventy this year and 
	suggested we do something special for her. Sandy loves plants and flowers, so a 
	marquetry piece of flowers is in order. I spent some time perusing botanical flower 
	drawings on the internet and came up with half a dozen I liked. The winner is shown 
	below. And my thanks to whomever created this picture. I have two months to complete, 
	finish and frame the piece.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS magnolias.jpg" alt="The beginning magnolia image" width="2121" height="3000">

<p>
	There were a few reasons this picture was chosen over the many other candidates. 
	First, it is a beautiful composition. Second, the colors are readily represented by 
	naturally colored veneers. Third, there are not a lot of fine details, which I 
	struggle to pull off at my skill level in marquetry. The biggest challenges this 
	picture presents is the veining in the leaves and the layering of the leaves and 
	petals. To some extent the veining can be realized with the figuring in the wood and 
	with boundaries between pieces of veneer. A few experiments might be in order. The 
	layering will be managed by judicious choice of packets and order of addition.
</p>

<p>
	There are many shades of color in each petal and leaf. Most of these will be 
	represented with closely matched veneers. The darker shadows will be produced by 
	burning the wood, using the, hot sand in a pan, technique learned at Marc Adams' 
	class on marquetry. I now have a hot plate and can try out this technique at home.
</p>

<p>
	With a picture in hand the next step is defining the areas for different veneers, by 
	outlining them on a printed version of the picture above. A brief attempt was made 
	to outline the colors in a drawing app, but it was more difficult than pencil on a 
	printout. Nine colors or shades of color were selected and areas on the printout 
	demarcated. The picture below shows these regions of color. These nine colors will 
	be supplemented by burning shadows on the appropriate color as needed.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS color regions.heic" alt="The different regions of color and shade marked out on the magnolia image" width="3353" height="4458">

<p>
	The colors are named as follows:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Orange</li>
	<li>Light Orange</li>
	<li>Pale Yellow</li>
	<li>White</li>
	<li>Dark Gray</li>
	<li>Light Gray</li>
	<li>Light Brown</li>
	<li>Dark Brown</li>
	<li>Pale Brown</li>
</ol>

<p>
	The picture outline and the outlines of all color regions were traced onto a clean 
	sheet of paper. Four copies of this tracing were made as these will be traced many 
	many times. The tracing is pictured below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS tracing.heic" alt="The different regions of color and shade traced onto paper" width="2960" height="3788">

<p>
	The packets are straightforward to delineate on this project, each leaf and petal 
	will be a packet for over 25 packets. A bigger challenge will be the order of cutting 
	them into the background. The packets are outlined in different colors in the photo 
	below. The stem and the center of the lower flower will also be considered a packet, 
	though the latter has only two parts.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS packets.heic" alt="The different packets defined and highlighted with color" width="2895" height="3501">

<p>
	Almost a month later, the dice are done and we have returned from Perdido Key. The 
	stash of veneer was pulled out and nine veneers plus background were selected. There 
	are no gray veneers, so these two colors were replaced with burls. The photo below 
	shows the ten veneers from one to nine. The printed picture is laying on the 
	background veneer.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS veneer selected.heic" alt="The ten different veneers selected for this flower" width="4067" height="4021">

<p class="note">
	The second task completed today was visiting Northwest Lumber and purchasing $340 of 
	oak needed for the Stickley floor lamp class the first weekend in May. Later this 
	week the boards will be rough cut to size.
</p>

<p>
	The packets were more clearly defined and labeled. There are four leaf packets on the 
	small flower; numbered by an imaginary clock face at 8, 10, 12, and 3. There are six 
	petal packets on the small flower: 7, 9, 11, 1, 2, and 4. Finally, there is the 
	center of the small flower, though it is only one veneer. The large flower has seven 
	leaf packets: 7, 10, 11, 1, 2, 3, and 4, followed by six petal packets: 7, 8, 10, 1, 
	3, and 4. That leaves the final three packets: the center packet of the large flower, 
	the stem and the bud.
</p>

<p>
	Work will begin with the simpler packets to get back into a groove and to explore 
	the fragility of the selected veneers. I am hoping to avoid softening the veneer for 
	this project. The relative humidity in the basement is 50%, so my fingers are crossed. 
	The first packets to be tackled are the large flower petal 7, and the small flower 
	leaf 3.
</p>

<p class="note">
	One complication that I need to take into account on most of the leaves is the 
	central spine. I am choosing to fake this spine on the affected leaves by grain 
	direction. These leaves have one veneer that spans the central spine. These will be 
	cut as two pieces on the spine with the grain flaring out. An early trial should 
	clarify whether this will suffice.
</p>

<p>
	Four packets were assembled this afternoon. The usual process was followed. The 
	rearmost segment was chosen and the matching veneer was prepped. The packet was first 
	copied onto the tracing paper and then onto this veneer. A piece of the next veneer 
	was green taped to the first and the design again traced onto it. The appropriate 
	line was noted as well as the direction of the cut so as to keep the top piece to 
	the left of the blade. The two parts were then separated and taped together along 
	the cut line with moistened veneer tape. From above the leaf on the small flower 
	at 3 and the petal on the large flower at 7 were the first two and both went well 
	as shown in the two photos below. Two petals from the small flower were also cut 
	together, 1 and 2. No major fracturing problems were encountered. All four packets 
	were placed under the cutting mat to dry and remain flat.
</p>

<p>
	Yesterday and today more packets were completed. The small flower petals and leaves 
	are all complete. Work is now starting on the large flower. These packets are more 
	complex. For instance the #7 leaf began with two pieces of the same #8 veneer, which 
	were cut together across the stem of the leaf. The bottom two veneers, #7 and #9 
	were put together before adding them to the combination of the #8 veneers. This 
	packet, upside down, is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS complex leaf.heic" alt="A complex leaf packet from the large flower" width="1753" height="1312">

<p>
	This morning all of the leaves for the large flower were completed, a complex set of 
	packets. In the afternoon the large flower petals were tackled. The goal is to complete 
	all of the packets before this weekend's <a href="https://www.marcadams.com">MASW</a> 
	class to make the Stickley floor lamp.
</p>

<p>
	By the end of Friday after the lamp class all of the flower packets were complete
	except for the center of the large flower and the stem. These were completed on 
	Saturday. The center of the large flower packet was more thoroughly document in the 
	nine photos below. The photos show the selected veneer for the very center of the 
	flower, the pattern traced onto the veneer, the second piece of veneer to be added, 
	the pattern traced onto the second veneer, arrows showing the direction of cut to 
	leave the new piece on the left side of the saw blade, the two new parts after the 
	first cut, the new piece positioned next to the old, veneer tape to hold the two 
	pieces together, and the third piece taped, traced and ready for cutting.

	With the center from above completed and the lower stem completed all of the packets 
	are now done. The photo below shows all twenty-seven of the packets in an approximation 
	of their final position in the picture. What a lovely flower!!
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS all packets.heic" alt="All of the packets completed" width="2226" height="2926">

<p>
	It is Mother's Day and time to consider cutting the packets into the background 
	veneer. The background veneer is quite fragile, wavy and needs to be softened prior 
	to cutting. Two pieces were cut each approximately 9"&nbsp;X&nbsp;11". These were 
	sprayed with commercial veneer softener on both sides. (Yes, I am giving it another 
	try.) The liquid was clearly soaking through the material as there were many spots 
	when turning it around to spray the second side. After letting the excess drain off 
	the veneer was placed between plywood cauls. The order of packing was: plywood, two 
	shop towels, screen, veneer, screen, two shop towels, screen, veneer, screen, two 
	shop towels, and plywood. The whole was place in the vacuum press at 10 am. 
	Surprisingly, the press holds vacuum for over two and one half minutes!
</p>

<p>
	The veneer came out flat and relatively soft! This softening is not supposed to last 
	for more than a few days, so cutting the packets into the background needs to begin. 
	The first addition will be the bud and its stem&mdash;good practice. The small flower 
	will be the second target and needs to be assembled prior to cutting in to the 
	background. The first priority for adding the flower is setting the 
	order of additions. The rearmost packets are the stem and the four leaves, none of 
	which overlap each other. The petals do have some overlap and overlap the leaves and 
	stem, so will be tackled before the leaves in the following order: 7, 9, 11, 1, 2, 
	and 4, followed by the flower's stem.
</p>

<p>
	The process begins by tracing a new upper flower from the magnolia onto tracing paper. 
	A piece of the #1 veneer had the flower's center traced on it. (Crosshairs were also 
	added and repeated as needed to align the tracing paper, growing flower and new bits.) 
	The petals and then the leaves were sequentially added to this central bit, the petals 
	in the order shown above and the leaves also in a clockwise order starting from 9 
	o'clock. The resulting flower is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS small flower.heic" alt="All of the packets for the small flower cut together and assembled" width="1584" height="1379">

<p>
	A similar path was followed for the large flower. With the petals added mostly in 
	clockwise order except for two at 2 and 7 o'clock added in after the first four. A 
	photo of the large flower <em>sans</em> leaves is shown below. The leaves will be 
	added tomorrow and followed by cutting into the background. The leaves were added 
	with only two added in a certain order, 2 and 1 o'clock. The stem was also added 
	completing the flower seen in the second photo below.
</p>

<p>
	Yet another sheet of transfer was graced with the magnolia flowers. Two crosshairs 
	were put on the tracing paper as well. The drawing was transfered to the background 
	veneer, along with the crosshairs. The bud was aligned with the drawing on the veneer 
	and taped in place. A hole was punched at the bottom corner of the stem, buried in 
	the yet to be added large flower. The blade was run through the hole and then the bud 
	was cut. It popped tightly into place as shown in the photo below and then taped with 
	veneer tape.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS bud in.heic" alt="The bud cut into the background veneer and showing the tight fit" width="1528" height="1574">


<p>
	The small flower was also cut in starting with a similar hole in the stem's extension. 
	Two pieces of the flower's veneer came loose and had to be glued into place. Another 
	nice tight fit. With all of the wet veneer tape the background veneer started to curl, 
	so it was placed under the cutting mat to dry, while being pressed flat. Below is a 
	photo of the small flower after drying. (The bit of background chipout will be lost 
	when the large flower is put in place.)
</p>

<p>
	The large flower was cut in last. What a long intense cut! There was one leaf petal 
	that got a little messed up when I lost the line, but it is not really noticeable. 
	The two pictures below show the two faces of the final product. Beyond a few repairs 
	the marquetry is complete! Need to celebrate tonight!
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS large flower back.heic" alt="The small flower cut into the background veneer and the design" width="2008" height="2545">

<p>
	Spent an hour or so repairing tearouts in the veneer. There are still a few holes 
	remaining, but are too tiny to fix with bits of veneer. These will be fixed after 
	glue-up with sawdust if needed. The marquetry tools were put away and a fine tooth 
	blade installed in the table saw. A 9"&nbsp;X&nbsp;11" rectangle of 1/4" plywood was 
	cut using the crosscut sled. A 9"&nbsp;X&nbsp;11&nbsp;1/4" piece of the "backing" 
	veneer was cut off and the backing veneer was rewapped and put away. The veneer and 
	backer board are seen in the photo below. Glue was spread on the backer board. The 
	veneer was applied and the package was placed in the vacuum press for three hours.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS back veneer.heic" alt="The veneer for the back of the picture along with the plywood substrate" width="2348" height="2385">

<p>
	The vacuum press was unsealed and the veneered backing was removed. The excess veneer 
	was cut off of the edges. The opposite side of the backing was covered with glue and 
	the marquetry was placed on the backing, veneer tape exposed. This stack was returned 
	to the vacuum press for three hours, marquetry side down. The photo shows the air 
	pressing and the glue drying. The second photo shows the "good" side after three hours 
	in the press

<p>
	Scraping was done this morning, a lot of scraping. After much work with little 
	reward, I realized how important flexing the scraper was to success. The scraping 
	then proceeded much more efficiently. After scraping >90% of the paper off both 
	sides of the panel were sanded. The back side, which had some glue scraped off, was 
	sanded from 120 to 220 grit. The front was sanded with 150 followed by 220 grit. Dust 
	was blown off with canned air. The back was signed. The pictures below record this 
	sequence of activities.

<p>
	The oak molding left over from the Banner marquetry project is a few inches too short 
	to make a frame, so back to Menards. More oak molding was purchased along with tools 
	for the Hammered Copper Mantle Clock class at <a href="https://www.marcadams.com">MASW</a> 
	next week. Turns out the molding on hand was sufficient for the task. The jig was used 
	to cut the four pieces of the frame. The glue-up jig was then used to properly align 
	the sides during gluing as seen in the photo below. The second photo shows the 
	picture in the frame after the glue had dried for an hour.
</p>

 <img class=inline src="sndmag/MMS pic in frame.heic" alt="The picture in the frame after the glue-up" width="3252" height="3086">

<p>
	Using the spline jig, the spline cuts were made across the corners of the frame. A 
	strip of 1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4" of walnut was cut from a scrap. Some sanding was 
	required before it fit in the cuts. This strip was cut into four 1&nbsp;5/16" long 
	splines. These splines were glued into the corner cuts and left to dry. The excess 
	was cut off and the remainder sanded flush. One corner chipped out and was repaired. 
</p>

<p>
	The repair job was cleaned up and the entire frame was sanded with 220 grit sandpaper 
	by hand. Dust was blown off of the frame in preparation for painting. The frame and 
	picture were painted with lacquer using a brush. The first of three coats went on 
	at 8:15 and was followed by two more coats each after a two hour drying time. The 
	photo below shows the lacquered picture sitting in the lacquered frame, but not yet 
	attached. The picture was attached with two small brass screws and two #6 washers. 
	A picture was installed on the top of the frame.
