<p class=first>
	This project started with a 1/4" X 3" X 5" aluminum bar which was cut diagonally 
	with a hack saw to rough dimensions: 2.907" X 5.043". The resulting triangle was 
	clamped to the table with 2 strap clamps and the base edge parallel to the front 
	of the table.
</p>
<p class=note>This project came from the "The Home Machinist's Handbook".

<p>
	The edges were carefully located and the spindle was set at 0.842" X 0.362" from 
	the bottom left corner (allowing 1/16" waste on both sides). The material was then 
	center drilled, drilled with a 7/32" bit and countersunk to the bottom of the 
	hole (0.25"). The table was moved 1.50" and the process was repeated for the second 
	hole. Moving back 1.50" and to the right 2.60" the third hole was drilled and 
	countersunk.
</p>

<p>
	The material was then clamped on large parallels with the base edge again parallel 
	to the table. This alignment was checked with the dial indicator ro make sure it 
	was well aligned. First, 0.062" of waste was removed with a 1/4" end mill. The table 
	was then moved 0.437" and a 1/4" slot was cut to a depth of 0.150". The short edge
	was then trimmed by 0.062" as well.
</p>

<p>
	The entire piece except for the long side was thinned to 0.125" with the triple 
	insert carbide cutter. Found that 0.010" at a slow speed gave a clean cut with 
	little "digging in".
</p>

<p>
	The work piece was reset so that the long edge was parallel with the back of the 
	table (again using the dial indicator for precision). This edge was trimmed 0.040". 
	The edges of the tool were deburred with a file. It was then sanded (100, 220, 320, 
	400 grit, and extra fine steel wool [000]) to give a polished face.
</p>

<p class=note>
	This has been my go to tool ever since for setting things parallel on the milling 
	table. Using this to set the vise is accurate to about 0.001" per inch of travel! 
</p>

<p class=note>
	Not mentioned above was that two attempts were made and only the second was 
	successful. If I remember correctly, the first was not properly aligned with the 
	milling table.
