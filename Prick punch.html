<p class=first>
	Lyle Peterson showed a prick punch he received in a video and I decided to make a 
	copy. I guessed on dimensions and wound up with a punch that is 5 1/2" total length. 
	The handle was designed to be made of 1/2" brass hex, the holder from 1/2" brass 
	round, and the tip from 5/16" oil hardening drill rod (O1).
</p>

<p>
	A 3" length of 1/2" brass hex was cut with a hacksaw. This was held in the lathe and 
	faced on one end. This end was rotated about 20&deg; and chamfered. This is the heel 
	of the handle. The opposite end was faced, lightly chamfered, and drilled with a 
	9/32" drill to a depth of 2 3/4". The first 3/4" was then opened up with a 5/16" 
	drill and tapped 3/8-16. The tap was started in the lathe and finished in a vise. 
	The sides were sanded to 400 grit for a matte finish.
</p>

<p>
	The holder was made next. The plan was to have two 3/4" ends that fit into the 9/32 
	hole in the handle. Between these two ends was a 3/4" length of threads. A hacksaw 
	was used to cut off a 2 1/4" length of 1/2" brass round stock. One was faced and 
	reduced for 3/4" to a diameter of 17/64". The end was then rounded with a file. The 
	part was reversed in the 3-jaw chuck and the opposite end was faced and reduced as 
	above. The end was center drilled. It was necessary to single point thread the 3/4" 
	center section. This end was then drilled with a #13 drill (0.184). All surfaces 
	were finished with 400 grit paper.
</p>

<p class=note>
	Threading was first attempted with a 3/8-16 die, but this bent the shaft so much 
	as to be unusable. The single point threading utilized a 60&deg; pointed bit, but 
	the point was too heavily rounded. The threads produced were functional, but the 
	crowns were too narrow.
</p>

<p>
	The tip was made from a length of 5/16 O1 drill rod as that was the 
	smallest on hand. The rod was faced and center drilled for a tailstock center and 
	then reduced for 2" to a diameter of 0.183". The headstock was offset 12.5&deg; and 
	the point was cut. The tip was then heated to cherry red for about 15 seconds and 
	quenched in oil. After oil removal the tip was reheated to a blue color. This 
	shaft was soldered into the holder, washed in water, and placed back in the lathe 
	for light sanding.
