<p class=first>
	I took Alan Lacer's class on woodturning at Marc Adam's School of Woodworking a 
	week ago. I would like to do some turning to remember what I learned and to make a 
	few things. The machine lathe needs some way to mount a tool rest before I can turn 
	wood. The tool rest mount will be mounted on the <a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Lathe%20Milling%20Table.html">lathe milling table.</a>
</p>

<img class=inline src="toolRst/TR parts.jpg" alt="A coupling and pipe nipple" width="1479" height="1752">

<p>
	I purchased two items from Grainger. One is a black pipe coupling. It is for 3/4" 
	pipe. It is round and has four holes in the base. The second is a short 
	threaded pipe nipple. It is also 3/4" pipe, schedule 160, thick walled with a 5/8" 
	ID. The picture above shows the nipple screwed into the coupling.
</p>

<p>
	The holes in the coupling are 5/8" ID. I don't want the 3/8-16 bolts to float so I 
	made four brass inserts. A 2" length of 3/4" brass hex was chucked in the three jaw. 
	It was reduced to 5/8" for most of its length. It had to be reduced to about 0.60" 
	to easily fit in the coupling's holes. A hole was drilled through the brass rod up 
	to 3/8". Two 1/2" lengths were parted off. The brass was flipped end for end in the 
	chuck and the opposite ended was similarly reduced to fit. This part was cut in half 
	with the parting tool. Both ends of the holes were chamfered as were the outsides of 
	all of the bushings.
</p>

<img class=inline src="toolRst/TR brass bushings.jpg" alt="Four bushings to adapt the holes from 5/8 to 3/8" width="1404" height="1171">

<p>
	The 'set' screw was made next. I wanted one with an attached handle so the tool rest 
	is easy to adjust as needed. A 1&nbsp;1/4" length of 1/2" mild steel hex was cut off 
	with the hacksaw. This part was faced and reduced to 1/2" for 3/4" and then to 0.190" 
	for 1/4". This reduced section was threaded with a 10-32 die. The screw was parted 
	off at 3/4" and drilled about 1/4" in from the end with a 7/32" drill. The threaded 
	end was held in the three-jaw chuck and set up on the 
	square collet block. The hole was adjusted close to vertical. Two flats were milled 
	on the 1/2" round part of the screw on opposite faces. Each flat was milled to a 
	0.13" depth. The burrs were removed. The completed screw is shown below.
</p>

<p>
	The pipe was held in the small vise with a vee block. An edge finder was used to 
	locate center on the 1.050" OD. It was drilled at the midpoint with a center drill 
	followed by a #21 drill. The hole was chamfered and tapped for 10-32 threads. The 
	ID was measured at 0.610". Luckily, I have a 5/8" reamer. Unfortunately, the reamer 
	was larger than 1/2" at the chucking end. A file indicated that this end of the 
	reamer was not hard. It was held in the three jaw chuck in the South Bend lathe. A 
	live center was used in the tailstock. It was reduced to slightly less then 0.50". 
	It could then be held in the tailstock drill chuck. The reamer was pushed through 
	the pipe with a lot of cutting fluid at slow speed. After a little cleanup a test 
	piece of 5/8" steel rod was inserted. It is a nice sliding fit. The photo below shows 
	the assembled tool rest holder at this stage.
</p>

<p>
	A handle was needed for the screw. the first attempt was made with steel. I tried to 
	hold a 5/8" piece of steel vertically with small vee blocks, but the part turned while 
	milling a groove with a sharp 3/16" end mill. The same milling was tried with the steel 
	rod clamped between two large vee blocks. Again the part turned. I was also unable to 
	use a saw. Even with a 0.01" depth of cut  the mill bogged down. I switched to brass. 
	A 2.5" length of 5/8" brass rod was cut off with a hacksaw after finding a sharp blade. 
	This was held in the vise with vee blocks and the vise raised on a block of wood. The 
	saw had already been aligned with the bottom of the cut from the attempted sawing in 
	steel. A 1/16" saw was used to make a cut 0.60" deep in 0.015" passes. The saw was 
	raised 1/16" and again the groove was cut to depth, but this time with 0.030" passes. 
	This was repeated a third time, again 1/16" higher. The screw is 0.220" thick. After 
	some measurements an additional 0.030" was removed on the top side and 0.010" on the 
	bottom side of the groove. The two photos show the setup and the fit of the screw.
</p>

<p>
	The handle was drilled after aligning the screw with the end and transferring the 
	hole. It was drilled with a center drill followed by a #21 drill. The hole on both 
	sides of the slot was threaded 10-32 and the top side was opened with a 7/32" drill. 
	The ends were faced and deburred with a file in the lathe. Using the South Bend lathe 
	a groove was cut with the parting tool about 1/4" back from the bottom of the screw 
	slot. The compound was set to about 2.5&deg; for the 1.5" long taper to the bottom of 
	the 1/16" slot. After cutting the taper the end was rounded with a file. The handle 
	was sanded from 150 to 1500 grit. It is shown in the two photos below. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	After assembly it became apparent that the screw slot ends need to be rounded off to 
	fit past the holder post. The end was rounded with a file and sanded to 400 grit.
</p>

<p>
	A simple screw to hold the handle on the set screw was made from a 1&nbsp;1/4" length 
	of 0.25" steel rod. The diameter 
	was reduced for 5/8" to 0.190". The first 1/4" was threaded with a 10-32 die. The 
	screw was parted off at 3/4" leaving a 1/8" head. The screw was put through the 
	handle and the set screw. A drop of Loctite was put in the threaded hole. The 
	auxiliary plate for the South Bend lathe was brought to the basement. Unfortunately, 
	the holes in the plate are 1.5" on center. Luckily, they are just a tad over 2" on 
	center on the diagonal. The tool rest mount fit using 3/8" screws, but without the 
	brass bushings made above. The final tool rest mount assembly is shown below. The 
	purchased screws were a little long so four washers are used beneath the heads.

<p class="note">
	Tackled one other small chore three days after finishing the support. I purchased 
	new Norton wheels for the grinder in order to better sharpen tools. When I installed 
	them one of the wheels did not run true. I removed the wheels this morning while snow 
	was falling outside. The wheel hubs were removed. They are just pot metal pressed 
	into shape. I put each of them in a four-jaw chuck on the Sherline lathe. One side 
	(near the center hole) was faced flat removing 0.005-0.010". The hub was flipped 
	over in the chuck and the flat face was pressed against an 1/8" thick aluminum spider 
	making it the reference face. The outer edge of the hub was similar faced flat by 
	removing only a bit of material creating parallel faces on opposite sides. After 
	reinstalling the wheels with the cleaned up hubs the wheels ran true.
