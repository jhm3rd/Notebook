<p class=first>
	We are babysitting the grandsons for three days next week. Rhea asked me to come up 
	with a construction project to keep them busy. I had previously considered 
	making a marble run. Upon further consideration that will be the project to keep them 
	busy. Designing the toy needs to not only take playing with it, but also a 5 and a 7 
	year old making it into consideration.
</p>

<p>
	I happen to have a 3/4" thick slab of 2'&nbsp;X&nbsp;3' particle board. This will 
	serve as the back of the marble run. It needs to lean back slightly so the marbles 
	stay on board (not bad as puns go). So it will need some legs. It will also have 
	sides to help contain the marbles. The bottom of the board will use an angled board 
	ending in a bowl (just happen to have the perfect bowl made during my turning class) 
	to catch all of the marbles. I am finishing it with the 1:3 shellac in EtOH over the 
	course of the day. The photo shows it after half a dozen coats.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR turned bowl.jpg" alt="Turned bowl to catch marbles" width="1493" height="1301">

<p>
	The board will be drilled for equally spaced holes. All of the attachments will have 
	tabs on them The tabs will hold the attachments on 1/4" dowels inserted into the 
	holes. A little figuring indicates that holes 2" on center will lead to a 14&deg; 
	angle on a 10" run. This seems about right. This will also put the tabs 4&nbsp;3/4" 
	apart on a 5" long run and 8&nbsp;1/2" apart on a 10" long run, placing the tabs  
	outside the dowels. For the 5" run dowels are placed down one hole and over two holes 
	(26&deg;) and for the 10" long run, down one and over four holes.
</p>

<p>
	I have 37 10" long strips of poplar from the tetrahedron project. They are 
	1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4". These strips will be used for the bottoms and the sides of the 
	runs. There will be four different styles of runs: smooth in 5 & 10" lengths and 
	slotted in 5 & 10" lengths. The sides will be glued to the outside of the bottoms. 
	Since two strips are needed for each 10" run, 12 long runs and 12 short runs can be 
	made from these strips. It is not clear how wide or how far apart the slots 
	in the slotted strips should be. Maybe 1/4" to 3/8" apart and similar width. Some 
	experiments will need to be done.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR poplar strips.jpg" alt="Poplar strips for the marble runs" width="2084" height="1927">

<p>
	I am considering two ways to make a pachinko style run. This could consist of eight 
	or more short (2") horizontal runs. A ball dropping onto such a run could go either 
	direction, so three or four rows would give some chaotic action. An example of this 
	is seen below. These could be made from popsicle sticks as shown. Alternatively, a 
	board with a heavily chamfered top edge (allowing the balls to easily move over the 
	edge of the board) could have brads inserted so as to mimic a pachinko run. This might 
	need a plexiglas cover like the input funnel described below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR pachinko.png" alt="One style of pachinko run" width="462" height="340">

<p>
	Some means of dropping the balls onto the top of the maze is needed. A type of funnel 
	with a gate at the bottom is planned. The rough plan is shown below. It consists of 
	two angled sides, a gated bottom with hole, and a plexiglas front. The gate would 
	simply be a hole with a sliding door to open and close the hole. The dimensions 
	depend on the size of the marbles. I pulled out a handful and measured them. They 
	ranged from 0.574" to 0.688" with most less than 0.625". I will consider the marbles 
	to be 5/8" in diameter and work from there. The marbles used might need to be 
	filtered. A throat width of 1" and a 3/4" hole should work well. Maybe a colorful 
	cloth back would look nice and hold the balls in if the funnel is above the top of 
	the backing board.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR input plan.jpg" alt="The plan for the marble input" width="1716" height="1403">

<p>
	The bottom will be made by drilling a marble sized hole through a block of wood. The 
	hole will be heavily chamfered. The block will be cut in half. One or both halves 
	will be hollowed out to fit a slide. The blocks will then be glued back together. 
	The slide could be a simple piece of wood or a piece with a hole drilled through. 
	Depending on the size of the input funnel it will be supported by dowels 4, 6, or 8" 
	apart.
</p>

<p>
	The final parts of the marble run under consideration are additional attachments to 
	add variety. One possibility is spinners. A wooden hub with a 1/4" hole would have 
	six slots cut in the outside. Paddles would be glued into these slots. The paddle 
	wheel would be placed on a dowel below a chute. A second possibility is a bell. An 
	old style bicycle bell might be ideal. It is not clear how to keep the marble in line
	after ringing the bell. A third possibility is a funnel. A kitchen funnel might make 
	the marbles revolve around on their way to the bottom, like an coin in orbit 
	demonstration in a museum. Again, a device needs to be made to get the marbles back 
	in line with the other chutes.
</p>

<p>
	At this pint three items need to be purchased. At least 75" of 1/4" dowel needs to 
	be purchased. A kitchen funnel, ideally aluminum, may also be available in the auto
	section. A bicycle bell, if they can still be found, would be fun. The boys should 
	be able to use a small saw, a hand drill, and screwdrivers, glue and paint. The 
	bench block was modified by adding a wall to keep small fingers holding a strip of 
	wood away from the saw. 
</p>

<p>
	My current plan is to make the board and mark the holes. Make the sides and prepare 
	them for attaching with screws. Make the legs and prepare for attachment with screws. 
	Make the marble receiver/bowl and again prepare for attaching with screws. The boys 
	can drill most of the holes in the board and then attach the sides, legs, and 
	receiver. I will mark and start cuts on the strips to be cut in half. I will cut 
	grooves in the rumble strips. The boys can finish the sawing and glue the strips 
	together to make the chutes. The boys will also glue the tabs to the bottoms of the 
	chutes. I will make the marble input funnel and let the boys screw it together. 
	I will make the hubs for two spinners and the boys can make and glue the paddles. If 
	possible, I will make a funnel holding device as well as one for a bell. They will 
	be made so some assembly is required and the boys can finish them. Finally, the boys 
	will decorate and paint everything.
</p>

<p>
	Began construction this morning. The biggest challenge was tackled first, attaching 
	the bowl to the bottom return. The board was cut to length and then cut at a 
	compound angle to mimic the addition of the return angle and the bowl angle. A lot 
	of time was spent with the rasp and finally with the Dremel. The rasp got the angle
	and the circumference of the bowl. A sanding wheel in the Dremel helped with the 
	curve of the bowl's side. Two holes were put through the bowl and two screws were 
	driven into the return.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR bowl on.jpg" alt="The bowl attached to the return with screws" width="1928" height="1968">

<p>
	The return was attached by setting the angle, marking the top and end, drilling 
	through holes, drilling for screw heads from the back, transferring the holes to 
	the return, drilling the holes in the return, and screwing the return to the back. 
	The left side was cut to fit and attached the same way the return was with 
	#10-1&nbsp;1/2" wood screws. The right side was cut to fit and attached at a slight 
	angle. Before attaching a marble was run down the return, hit the side, and dropped 
	into the bowl. The right side was attached after sanding where needed. A lip needs 
	to be made for the return.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR sides & return.jpg" alt="The return and both sides attached to the back" width="2055" height="2631">

<p>
	A grid was plotted out for the dowel holes. Before any were drilled a few test holes 
	were drilled in a scrap of particle board. The 1/4" dowel I have on hand was tested 
	in these holes. The F drill was perfect, a little tight but not too tight. A few 
	holes were punched and drilled with a stop set at 5/8".
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR hole grid.jpg" alt="Drilling the grid of holes" width="2055" height="2631">

<p>
	Most of the holes were drilled as shown below. About 20 were left for the boys to 
	drill. The stop slipped and one row was drilled almost through. A scrap of the 
	material used for the ball return had a 1/2" length cut from one side. This scrap 
	was split down the middle with a coping saw making two lengths that are 
	1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2". One cut face of each was sanded on the belt sander. A full 
	length piece was glued to the edge of the return. The second piece was cut to fit 
	and the end cut at a 45&deg; angle. It was also glued to the outer edge of the return 
	forming a wall as seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR return wall.jpg" alt="Gluing the wall on the return" width="2220" height="1982">

<p>
	The next step was making the ribbed tracks. These should make some noise. I started 
	with a 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/8" groove. A piece of scrap was prepped. The table saw 
	blade was equipped with the dado washers set to 3, which according to the story 
	board should give a 1/4" groove. The first groove was cut with the scrap held against 
	a stop. Two 1/4" blocks of wood were placed between the stop and the scrap and 
	another cut was made. Three more cuts were made with an additional two blocks each 
	time. As it turns out the width of the cuts is 5/16", so the gap between successive 
	cuts is 3/16". This was held against the back and marble rolled down the scrap. The 
	marble bounced a little as it hit the cuts, but there was not enough noise for the 
	effort. Since making the ribbed tracks is a lot of work, I decided to pass.
</p>

<p>
	I pulled out two hole saws and dropped a marble on them. They both gave a nice 
	"plink". I need to hit the store as I don't like the idea of filing the teeth 
	off the hole saws. Time to make some hubs for the spinners. A 1" diameter dowel was 
	located and 3" was sawed off. An attempt was made to use the three jaw chuck and 
	the indexing block, but the chuck did not hold the wood tight enough to mill. The 
	chuck left nice index marks in the wood. The wood was turned in the chuck so one 
	index mark was centered between two jaws and the chuck tightened. This left six 
	evenly spaced marks on one end of the dowel.
</p>

<p>
	The marked dowel was held in the vise. The spindle was centered over the dowel 
	after touching off on the fixed jaw. The dowel was rotated until an index mark was 
	centered under the 3/16" end mill. The end mill was lowered to the top of the dowel. 
	Four passes of 0.050" depth for three and 0.038" for the fourth were made to giving 
	a 2" long square groove. This was repeated for the other five marks. The part was 
	drilled up to an I drill, which gave an easily spun cylinder on a 1/4" dowel. Two 
	1" lengths of this grooved cylinder were cut off with a saw.
</p>

<p>
	An 8" long 1&nbsp;1/2" square block of wood was used for the next steps. Two 3/16" 
	thick slabs were cut off with the table saw. Twelve 1" wide lengths of this were 
	sawed off by hand. These paddles were cleaned up with the disk sander. All corners 
	were chamfered except for one end to fit in the grooved hub. The hubs and paddles 
	are shown in the following photo. They are ready to be glued up by the boys after 
	the paddles are shortened by 1/4-1/2".
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR hubs & paddles.jpg" alt="The finished hubs and paddles" width="1380" height="1675">

<p>
	The vanes were shortened by 1/2" and the sawed ends flattened on the disk sander. An 
	old prototype music box was located. It was cleaned up on the sanding belt. With two 
	holes it should make a nice sound when the marble hits it. Went to Menard's this 
	morning and purchased 1/4" poplar dowels, funnels and a set of four hole saws. The 
	smallest hole saw had most of the teeth filed off on the belt sander. The burr on 
	the outside was sanded off on the disk sander. There was still a bit of a burr 
	between the stumps of teeth. These were filed off with a round file as was the inside 
	burr. The two musical devices are shown below along with audio clips of a marble 
	hitting the hole saw bell and the music box.
</p>

<p>
	The tip was cut off one of the three funnels purchased so a marble easily fits 
	through. The marble when sent in at an angle runs around the funnel a few times 
	before dropping out the bottom. Holding the funnel at an angle to the back board 
	drops the marble against the back board. A holder of some sort needs to be made for 
	the funnel. So a holder for the funnel, inserts for the bells, the support legs, and 
	the ball input remain to be completed.
</p>

<p>
	The ball input was begun this afternoon after the boys left. A 3" length of 
	1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/8" stock was cut off. It was sliced down the middle leaving 
	two 9/16" wide sections. The two were clamped together and drilled through with a 
	3/4" Forstner bit. This hole was purposely drilled very close to one side. This side 
	will be against the back board. Before going further the key needed to be made.
</p>

<p>
	A 4" length of 1/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" brass was found in the scrap. The desired key 
	shape was laid out after bluing the brass as seen below. Six cuts were made with 
	the hacksaw. The large cutout was removed by cutting on the XXX saw. The blade 
	broke cutting a smaller cutout so the coping saw was used to finish the last two 
	cutouts. The cutout key is seen in the second photo.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR key rough cut.jpg" alt="The key roughly cut to shape" width="2009" height="1181">

<p>
	The corners that need to be rounded on the handle were rounded with a course file. 
	The edges were all cleaned up with a fine three-corner file. The handle end of the 
	key was sanded from 220 to 2000 grit. The handle end was polished on the polishing 
	wheel with red rouge. The two photos below document this process.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR key polished.jpg" alt="The key sanded and polished" width="2066" height="1403">

<p>
	With the key finished the critical distance from the end to the ball opening was 
	measured. This distance needs to be the same as the distance from the hole edge to 
	a stop. When the key is pushed against a stop the hole needs to be open. This 
	distance was measured and marked. Holes were marked for a 1/8" drill 1/16" from the 
	marked line. A similar line was marked on the other end of the drop box. One hole 
	was drilled at this time in this location to serve as a stop when the hole is 
	covered by the key. These three holes are shown in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR drop box drilled.jpg" alt="The drop box drilled for the stops" width="1740" height="1588">

<p>
	Three 1&nbsp;1/8" lengths of 1/8" dowel were cut. Glue was put into the three 
	bottom holes. The dowel pins were pushed into these three holes with the aid of 
	the vise. Glue was placed in the top holes. The pins wee aligned with these holes 
	and with the vise the pins were pushed into the top block until the key was a 
	decent fit between the two halves. The picture shows the two halves pinned together.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR drop box pinned.jpg" alt="The drop box with the stop pins installed" width="1838" height="1367">

<p>
	The glued and pinned box was sanded. The hole was chamfered on the two sides. A 
	length of 1" wide wood was prepared and cut into two parts with 35&deg; angles on 
	their ends. The These pieces were glued to the top edges of the box to form the 
	funnel for the marbles. After letting the glue dry a small scrap of wood was glued 
	into the back corner of the slot where there was no pin. The key was put in place 
	before this glue-up locking it in.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR input.jpg" alt="The sides of the input box installed next to chamfered hole" width="1886" height="1658">

<p>
	The back board was propped against a wall at what seemed to be a good angle. The 
	angle was locked into the sliding bevel. Six pieces of 1&nbsp;X&nbsp;2 were cut to 
	approximate length. The angles were laid out on the wood parts and cut. The acute 
	angles had to be filed to the line. Screw holes were laid out, one per joint. The 
	holes were drilled and transferred to the mating part. The boards were glued and 
	held together with the screws. The angles are not exact, but are close enough.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR legs.jpg" alt="The legs to support the board at an angle" width="2345" height="1713">

<p>
	The funnel needs to be angled so the exiting marble will land on a run. With the 
	board at the final angle, the funnel was held against the board with a scrap of 
	wood between. The desired funnel angle was marked on the wood. The angle was cut 
	and rasped to the line. A round rasp was used to put a slight curve in the funnel 
	facing side. Two holes were drilled through with a 1/4" drill two inches apart. The 
	bottom hole (top in the photo) is not deep enough for a standard 1&nbsp;1/2" peg. A 
	shorter peg will be glued in place. The top hole may be turned into a slot for 
	easier fitting.
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR funnel support.jpg" alt="The support for the funnel" width="1160" height="1322">

<p>
	Tried out the funnel support and it did not work!. The top is too far from the 
	back. The ball drops onto the support and not into the funnel. I will make some 
	pegs permanently mounted to the funnel. In this fashion the funnel will be pressed 
	against the back and then the ball drops neatly into the funnel. Two 1/2" pegs 
	were cut. Holes were drilled through the pegs down the middle for #4 screws. The 
	funnel was marked for holes 2" apart. These were drilled; screws were installed 
	through the holes and into the pegs. The photo shows the result. And best of all 
	it works!
</p>

<img class=inline src="marbRun/MR funnel pegs.jpg" alt="Pegs installed on the funnel" width="1621" height="1705">

<p>
	A 1/8" acrylic plate was cut for the front of the ball input. The plate was laid on 
	the funnel and the sides were marked with a razor blade. The score marks were gone 
	over with the blade five or six times. The acrylic was snapped at the score marks. 
	In order to drill through the acrylic for screws a punch mark was attempted on one 
	hole. The corner of the acrylic cracked off! Now I have a less than perfect acrylic 
	plate. The holes were transferred to the wood sides and screws installed. Not bad 
	even with the corner dingus. It just needs some fabric stapled to the back.
</p>

<p>
	The chimes needed a few modifications to hang it on the board. Two 1" pegs were cut. 
	They were glued into holes drilled into the back of the box 2" apart. A wall with 
	mitered ends was cut and glued to the front of the box. The photo shows the wall 
	and box held in the vise while the glue dried.
</p>

<p>
	The boys were put to work this morning. The two boys drilled the remaining fifty or 
	so holes in the backboard with a little help holding the heavy cordless drill. They 
	also each cut a 4' length of 1/4" dowel into 1&nbsp;1/2" pegs. Levi is shown below 
	doing the peg sawing.

<p>
	No boys today so the nine 10" marble tracks were glued up. After the clamps were 
	freed up the tabs were glued to the bottoms. They were set 1&nbsp;1/2" in from the 
	ends. The backboard was sprayed with two coats of white primer. A trial run was in 
	order. The marble moves really fast. Maybe the short tracks should be slotted.

<p>
	Laid three pieces of the poplar 10" lengths side by side on the table saw. The blade 
	was fitted with the dado arbor set to #2. This gave a groove 9/32" wide. Grooves were 
	cut 1/8" deep down the length of the three pieces spaced 9/32" apart. The grooves 
	were cleaned up with sandpaper. The grooved lengths were glued to a second set of 
	10" lengths serving as a wall. After the glue dried these slotted marble tracks were 
	cut in half. The ends were all sanded (as were the ends of the previously made 
	marble tracks). These short tracks were too short for two tabs when placed over two 
	pegs spaced two over and one down. Only one tab was glued on right at the end of the 
	short track. Three were glued on one end and three on the other as they are  
	asymmetrical with one tab attached.

	Levi helped glue up the spinners. I applied the glue and he put the vanes into the 
	hubs. We wrapped rubber bands around them to serve as clamps. They are shown as 
	installed on the board below.
