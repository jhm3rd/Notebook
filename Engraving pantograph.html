<p class=first>
	Looking through my list of potential projects, a pantograph for engraving was 
	discovered. It is shown below. I have not been able to find any other information 
	on this photo of Bruce Holmquist's work. The post originally came from Metal Web 
	News, but the post is no longer  available and Bruce could not be located via a 
	simple web search. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG bruce.png" alt="Pantograph by Bruce Holmquist" width="574" height="364">

<p>
	My first challenge was learning how to design a pantograph from a geometrical 
	perspective. One <a href="https://www.peter.com.au/articles/pantograph.html">website</a> 
	was particularly helpful by Peter Lewis of Australia. A key takeaway from the 
	multiple websites consulted was that three points had to be colinear, the fixed 
	point, the tracing point, and the drawing point. The scale of transformation is 
	then the ratio between the fixed and drawing points distance to the drawing and 
	tracing point distance. (Cringe!!)
</p>

<p>
	This pantograph will be used to transfer large designs to smaller engravings on 
	metal. After deciding to utilize two fixed scales in this pantograph, 2X and 3X a 
	number of pantograph sizes were explored by the use of a spreadsheet. Key for this 
	design is locating one of the engraving points (the location of the spinning graver) 
	on one small arm and the other on the other small arm. This is more easily seen in 
	the crude sketch below than described. The solid dots are pivots, the open circles 
	are engraver locations, and the dot in a circle is the tracer location.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG sketch.heic" alt="Rough pantograph sketch" width="2600" height="1780">
<img class=inline src="images/PNTG spreadsheet.png" alt="A spreadsheet for pantograph calculations" width="2520" height="1106">

<p class = "note">
	As can be seen in the spreadsheet 12" and 18" lengths for the long legs were 
	propitious choices!
</p>

<p>
	The spreadsheet calculated key dimensions for this pantograph, namely the distances 
	between pivot points and the distances of the two scribing locations. The material 
	chosen is 1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" aluminum square tube. 47" of the aluminum are required. 
	Bruce used square tube and I plan to as well. 
</p>

<p>
	The next design issue is making the pivots, so they have little give in the x, y, or 
	z directions, but rotate easily. Reaming the holes in the bars to an exact size and 
	using drill rod as the pins, threaded on both ends, should be sufficient. Spacers 
	will be used between bars and washers on the outsides. Something like nyloc nuts 
	might provide the tight, but not too tight, attachment. The support shaft also 
	serves as a pivot and will require a base and clamping mechanism of some sort.
</p>

<p>
	The other two parts to design are the jigs to hold the scribe and the Dremel 
	extension shaft. These require consideration of setting the appropriate height for 
	the cutting tool and thus setting the height at the fixed end and at the scribe. 
	Ideally all of this would be controlled by a mechanism at the fixed endpoint. More 
	practically the pantograph will have some inherent flex, so setting the height may 
	need to be done at both the fixed end, the scribing end, and at the cutting spindle. 
	Another issue is how is the scribe easily moved between disconnected parts of the 
	design without upsetting height settings. Maybe a vertical movement of the spindle 
	accompanied by a stop?
</p>

<p class = "note">
	Looking at Bruce's version I noticed the setscrews holding the scribes in position. 
	These setscrews should be moved to the opposite side, more challenging to adjust, 
	but out of the way when looking at the scribe on the diagram. Or maybe moved to the 
	side.
</p>

<p>
	My current plan is to explore all of these issues and more with a wooden prototype. 
	This prototype was my first goal and was a learning experience. Some wood scraps 
	were located: one was 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;5/8" and the other was 5/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;5/8". 
	The following lengths were cut: 19", 13", 9", and 7". Centered holes were marked 
	with the following separations: 18" on the 19" length, 12" on the 13", 8" on the 9", 
	and 6" on the 7". A hole was marked at 6" on the long arm and at 8" on the 13" arm. 
	Two holes were marked for the pencil, one on the 9" arm at 8" and one on the 7" arm 
	at 4.5". All holes were drilled 1/4" except for the latter two which were drilled 
	with an L drill, 0.290, to fit the 0.30" pencil. Carriage bolts, washers and screws 
	were used to assemble the pantograph.
</p>

<p>
	A square of particle board had a 1/4" hole drilled in one corner. A 1" length of 
	1/4" ID brass tube was cut from scrap. A long carriage bolt went through this 
	board, through the tube and through the fixed hole on the 13" arm. A pencil was 
	pushed through the larger hole at the ostensible X2 scale position. A punch went 
	through the 1/4" hole at the scribe end of the 19" arm. With the board and a sheet 
	of paper clamped to the table saw and a demo engraving set under the scribe, a test 
	was conducted. The transfer went very well, More care should have been taken to 
	raise the scribe at the end of each letter, but most were clear as seen in the first 
	photo below. The second shows the device as used. The scale is clearly not 2:1, but 
	is 3:1!!!
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG first transfer.heic" alt="The first transfer done with the mockup" width="2053" height="1722">
<img class=inline src="images/PNTG wooden mockup.heic" alt="The wooden mockup as it was set up for a transfer" width="2610" height="3362">

<p class = "note">
	I clearly misunderstood the relevant dimensions determining magnification. I used a 
	2:1 dimension of the distance between the pencil and the scribe on the long arm 
	relative to the distance between the pencil and the fixed point on the shorter arm. 
	I should have used the distance between the fixed point and the scribe to the 
	distance of the pencil point from the fixed point, i.e. 2X is a pencil point centered 
	between the fixed point and the scribe.
</p>

<p>
	The spreadsheet was corrected, producing new dimensions. Only one new bar had to be 
	made, a 9" bar, and a leftover from cutting the first four bars was exactly 9"! 
	The new dimensions are shown in the rough sketch below (sketch is not dimensionally 
	accurate).
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG rough sketch II.heic" alt="A rough sketch of the corrected pantograph dimensions" width="2782" height="1856">

<p>
	The pantograph was remade with the new dimensions shown above and produced a two-fold 
	reduction as expected. Using the pantograph highlighted a number of issues that will 
	need to be addressed in the final version. First, with the fixed pivot as the main 
	support, there is a lot of vertical play as the weight of the pantograph is all off 
	to the same side. Second, rigidity of the scribe and the 
	pencil, in this case, had a big impact on the ability to accurately follow the 
	pattern and produce an adequate representation. Third, the ability to lift the 
	pencil is paramount to transferring anything other than a continuous line, conflicting 
	with the first issue.
</p>

<p>
	Aluminum square tubing, 1" with 1/8" wall thickness, was ordered along with a base 
	plate, 1/4" aluminum plate.
</p>

<p>
	A modification was made to the prototype to see if it could be used for wood 
	engraving. The Dremel's flex-shaft is 1/2" in diameter with 0.003" increases for the 
	knurls. The pencil hole was opened to 1/2" after carefully aligning the drill press 
	spindle with the pencil hole. A scrap of wood was screwed to the side of the cross 
	piece centered on the 1/2" hole. A cross hole was made with a #29 drill and tapped 
	8-32. An 8-32 aluminum screw was located and the resulting arm, ready for the Dremel 
	is seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG large hole.heic" alt="The enlarged hole to fit the Dremel extension" width="2038" height="1630">

<p>
	Testing the pantograph prototype with the Dremel was explored this morning. The 
	Dremel was set up with a 0.072" end mill in the flex-shaft. A few "modifications" 
	were made to the prototype. First, a stack of 1/2" of washers on top of the brass 
	spacer was used to raise the pantograph. A block of wood was set under the outbound 
	side of the pantograph for support. A second block of wood, patterned hex in the 
	photo below, was used to raise the bit off of the wood. The wood to be cut was taped 
	to the prototype's table with double sided tape. The pattern to be transfered, my 
	favorite metalworking magazine, was also clamped at an appropriate height for the 
	transfer, a block of wood rests under the letter "M". The Dremel was switched on and 
	the "M" was followed slowly with the scribe. With all of the sawdust nothing could 
	be seen until it was brushed away. Success!! Much better than expected as seen in 
	the second photo below with fuzzies still attached.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG router setup.heic" alt="The pantograph set up to use the Dremel flex-shaft as a router." width="2705" height="2466">
<img class=inline src="images/PNTG M.heic" alt="The routed letter M transferred from the magazine" width="1630" height="1474">

<p>
	 The only real issue is the need for some means of controlling cutting depth. Would 
	 an inexpensive dial caliper serve this purpose? A lock of some kind would also be 
	 required. My first thought was to make a split collet to hold the flex-shaft and 
	 slide through the hole in the arm. The diameter of the split collet would be 
	 difficult to control giving a poor fit in the arm, so a simpler collet with a set 
	 screw will be used instead. A sketch of this setup is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG caliper collet.heic" alt="The routed letter M transferred from the magazine" width="1630" height="1474">

<p class = "note">
	Note, the caliper needs to be oriented correctly or it will hide the dial behind the 
	flex-shaft.
</p>

<p>
	The selected inexpensive dial caliper jaw was readily marked with a file. A length 
	of 0.750" round steel rod was located and a 4" length was cut off with the hacksaw. 
	Both ends were faced using a collet in the South Bend lathe. Made an attempt to 
	drill the through hole, but the chuck was frozen and would not tighten on a 1/2" 
	shank center drill. 
</p>
	
<p>
	A quick check of a drill chuck repair video on YouTube revealed 
	that the outer ring needs to be pressed off. Purchased a 4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/2" 
	galvanized pipe nipple. This with a heavy ball peen hammer, a block of wood and 
	much effort removed the outer ring of the chuck. The "broken" nut was extracted and 
	the problem became immediately apparent, the threads were broken off as seen in 
	the photo below. A new chuck was ordered from Shars, they don't carry repair kits 
	for this brand of chuck, and will arrive in four days!
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG chuck threads.heic" alt="The broken nut extracted from the drill chuck showing the damaged threads" width="2112" height="1954">

<p>
	In the meantime work began on the pantograph arms. The 1" square aluminum tube that 
	was purchased was cut into four lengths: 20", 14", 10", & 9" with a hacksaw. The 
	ends were deburred. The locations of the pivot holes were carefully marked out and 
	punched. One hole was marked at the end of a bar and then the second was carefully 
	located at the desired distance from the first. All bars were held on a block of wood 
	on the milling table with two step clamps. The hole was located with a 1/16" drill, 
	drilled with a #1 drill, then a "T" drill, and finally reamed 3/8". The holes were 
	deburred. The first photo below shows the pantograph bars cut and the second shows 
	them at this stage of construction.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG bars drilled.heic" alt="The pibot holes drilled in the four pantograph bars" width="2776" height="2539">

<p>
	The spacers, which will reside between the aluminum bars at the four pivot points 
	were made from a length of 3/4" aluminum rod. This rod was faced and a skim cut was 
	taken to clean up the outside diameter. A 3/8" hole was drilled and reamed about 3/4" 
	deep. Four washers were parted off at 1/8". These washers were deburred and are seen 
	in the photo below. (These won't get much wear, thus the choice of aluminum.)
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG washers.heic" alt="The washers or spacers which will separate the bars" width="1689" height="1564">

<p>
	The axles which will serve as the pivots were made from 3/8" drill rod. Four 
	2&nbsp;7/8" lengths were cut off with a hacksaw. The rods were faced, 0.40" 
	reduced to 0.248", and heavily chamfered on the end of the nascent screw. This 
	same operation was performed on both ends of all four rods, production mode. The 
	axles are a close fit through the washers and maybe too close of a fit through the 
	bars. A quick touch-up with a reamer did not help.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG axles sized.heic" alt="The axles without threading the ends" width="1891" height="1499">

<p>
	Using a reamer in the drill press helped most of the holes accept the axles. One 
	hole required a 3/8" drill. All of the holes and axles fit better after putting the 
	axles in and spinning the bars for a bit. Even though I cannot yet start on the 
	Dremel flex-shaft holder I decided to make it out of brass as it won't require 
	screwing to the spacer, but can be soldered. Still waiting on the drill chuck, so 
	the axles were threaded 1/4-20 with a die. The lathe and die holder were not usable 
	as the chuck could not hold the axle tight enough. All eight ends were threaded by 
	hand in the vise. Drill rod at this size was at my limit. I need a larger hand die 
	holder for these small dies.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG axles threaded.heic" alt="The axles threaded and now complete" width="1682" height="1402">

<p>
	Significant work remains to be done on the bars, but a quick assembly was in order 
	this morning. Washers will be needed under the to be purchased locknuts. The setup 
	is quite a bit more rigid than the wooden prototype and yet moves easily.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG first assembly.heic" alt="The bars assembled into a functioning mechanism, though not yet a pantograph" width="2032" height="2565">

<p>
	With the new drill chuck in hand work commenced on the flex-shaft support tube. A 
	3&nbsp;1/2" length of 3/4" brass round bar was cut from stock. While held in a 
	collet on the South Bend lathe, it was faced, center drilled and drilled up to 
	31/64". The hole was reamed with a 1/2" reamer and then bored until the flex-shaft 
	was a sliding fit, 0.505". The second end was faced and both ends slightly 
	chamfered inside and out. The two photos below show the support at this point.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG flex support.heic" alt="The support tube for holding the Dremel flex-shaft" width="1680" height="1400">
<img class=inline src="images/PNTG flex in support.heic" alt="The support tube holding the Dremel flex-shaft" width="1876" height="1591">

<p>
	A set screw needs to be installed in the tube. The next part to be made is the spacer 
	for attaching the top caliper jaw to the just made tube. There are two ways of making 
	this that come to mind. A block of brass can be line bored to produce the desired 3/8" 
	radius cutout. Alternatively, a large block of brass can be drilled up to 3/4" and 
	then cut in half. Drilling two smaller blocks of brass clamped together might also be 
	a possibility. Of course, boring could replace some of the larger drills. 
</p>

<p>
	My brass stock of sufficient size is quite limited so line boring was the chosen 
	methodology, necessitating making a boring bar. The bar was made from 1/2" hex steel. 
	A 4" length was held in the three-jaw chuck on the Sherline lathe, faced and center 
	drilled on both ends. The hex was cross drilled and reamed for a 1/8" hole. The bar 
	was turned 90&deg; and after making a flat with an end mill a hole was drilled into 
	the first with a #43 drill and then threaded 4-40 for a set screw. 
</p>

<p>
	A 5/8" length of 1/8" drill rod was cut off with a hacksaw. This short rod was 
	mounted in a collet and the end cut to a 60&deg; included angle. The tip was rounded 
	with a file. This now pointed rod was held in the milling vise and an end mill was 
	used to remove half of the point. The cutting tool was heated to cherry red with a 
	propane torch and quenched in motor oil. The flat face of the tool was honed with a 
	fine stone. 
</p>

<p>
	Meanwhile, a block of scrap brass 1&nbsp;X1/8" square and 1/2" thick was squared up 
	in the mill. This was mounted on scrap to raise it 3/8" above the lathe cross slide. 
	The cutting tool made above was mounted in the bar of hex such that it protruded by 
	1/8" and the entirety was mounted between centers on the lathe. This is shown in the 
	first photo below. The tool and setup worked perfectly cutting an arc from the brass 
	in increments of 0.005". The finished brass piece is seen in the second photo. The 
	third shows the perfect fit between the 3/4" cylinder and the caliper mount. The 
	fourth photo shows the things completed this morning.
</p>

<p>
	The width of the top spacer beyond the cylinder is 0.319". The width of the square 
	tubing beyond the same cylinder is 0.125", so a spacer needs to be made for the 
	bottom caliper blade, 0.194" thick. The part was quickly made from a scrap of 
	1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" brass. It was drilled with 6-32 through holes 5/8" apart centered 
	across the spacer as seen in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG spacer.heic" alt="The spacer for the lower caliper jaw" width="998" height="916">

<p>
	The caliper was mounted in the vise on the mill in preparation for drilling through 
	holes for the 6-32 screws. After marking the caliper blades with a punch the center 
	drill did not touch the steel. The steel of the caliper blades is softer than a file, 
	but harder than an HSS drill. A carbide spotting drill readily began a hole, but I 
	have no carbide drills less than 1/4". A quick trip to Menard's where a cobalt 
	titanium drill was purchased, 7/64", was a waste of time as this drill also didn't 
	touch the hardened steel. Should a different attachment method be devised or should 
	a carbide drill, $12, be ordered online?
</p>

<p>
	Working on my birthday following a lovely dinner out with the wife last night. After 
	deciding on the clamp option two clamps were made from 1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4" square 
	aluminum cutoffs. A 1/2" slot was milled down the middle of the clamps about 1/16" 
	deep. A through hole for a 6-32 screw was drilled just inside the slot. The two 
	spacers from above were also modified. A 0.02" slot was milled in each and a hole 
	was drilled and threaded just above this slot. The clamp for the lower jaw still 
	needs to have the attachment holes countersunk. The third photo below shows the 
	clamps holding the spacers tightly to the caliper jaws.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG clamped.heic" alt="The spacers clamped to the caliper jaws" width="2371" height="2036">

<p>
	The lower spacer was returned to the mill vise and held on parallels. One hole was 
	aligned using the through drill and the drill chuck switched to the collet with a 
	1/4" end mill. This was lowered into the spacer 0.085" producing the countersink. 
	The table was moved 0.625" and the operation was repeated on the second hole. The 
	screw heads are 0.259" diameter so the holes were further opened using an H drill. 
	The screws are a nice fit as seen below.
</p>

<p>
	The shorter arms were previously marked for the holes at 6". These were drilled 
	this morning up to 3/4" through both sides. After some work with a file the flex-shaft 
	support tube was a reasonable fit in both as seen in the photo below. The less than 
	perfect fit in a non-reamed hole reminded me that a hole needs to be drilled and tapped 
	for a set screw.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG drill.heic" alt="The holes in the two short arms drilled to fit the flex-shaft holder" width="3173" height="2262">

<p>
	Both small arms were marked out for the screws needed to hold the bottom spacer in 
	place. These holes were then drilled and tapped for 6-32 screws. The outside and 
	inside were deburred. The opposite sides were marked for set screw holes, which were 
	drilled and tapped for 8-32 screws. Finally, the bottom of each arm was marked with 
	an electric engraver. The two photos below show the results of these actions.

<p>
	The upper spacer block was soldered to the flex-shaft support tube. The combination 
	was cleaned up a bit with 600 grit sandpaper as seen below. The entire apparatus at 
	this stage of construction was assembled as seen below. It is sturdy as a rock! All 
	that is left is the back pivot post and the scriber attachment.

<p>
	Finishing up the flex-shaft mounting attachment requires a set screw installed in 
	the tube and fabrication of a stop collar. Then work can begin on the scribe and 
	its attachment to the longest bar, as well as determining how best to make the main 
	pivot and base.
</p>

<p>
	Two 8-32 set screws were made from 3/8" brass hex. The tube with attached upper 
	mounting block was held in the milling vise and the spindle centered over the tube.
	The tube was drilled through with a #29 drill and tapped 8-32. After a bit of 
	cleanup the set screw was installed as seen below. 
</p>

<p>
	A 1&nbsp;1/8" O.D. brass ring magically appeared in my brass scrap box. It was about 
	3/8" wide. Both ends were faced and the inside bored to fit the flex-shaft support 
	tube. After chamfering corners and light sanding on the outside it was drilled 
	on center and tapped 8-32. The stop collar is shown below installed on the tube.
</p>

<p>
	A support for the scribe was quickly designed and made. A 
	1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/8" block of brass was cut from stock with 
	the horizontal bandsaw. The two cut ends were squared up in the mill and then two 
	shoulders were cut on opposite 1" sides. These were cut 0.25" deep and 0.25" wide. 
	The corners were all deburred. The block at this stage is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG scribe block.heic" alt="The scribe block cut to size" width="1320" height="1260">

<p>
	The block was returned to the mill vise and set up for drilling the holes for screws 
	to attach it to the aluminum square tube. Two holes were drilled as through holes for 
	6-32 screws. These holes were countersunk with a 1/4" end mill. The block was then 
	centered in a four-jaw chuck and drilled up to an A drill. It was reamed 1/4" for the 
	yet to be made scribe.
</p>

<p>
	The scribe holder was finished by drilling and tapping a cross hole for an 8-32 screw. 
	The scribe was made from a 4" length of drill rod. One end was faced and the rod 
	flipped end for end in the chuck. The opposite end was cut at a 60&deg; internal 
	angle almost to a point. The point was slightly rounded with a file. After again 
	flipping the rod in the chuck the non-pointy end was knurled and the end chamfered. 
	The completed scribe in the scribe holder is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG scribe.heic" alt="The scribe block completed with the scribe installed" width="1938" height="1512">

<p>
	A hole was drilled and reamed 1/4" on the long leg of the pantograph 18" from the 
	hole at its far end. The work had to be done on the drill press as the mill has a 
	major problem with the z-axis. In any event the work was readily accomplished even 
	though the table had to be moved between the drill and the reamer. The photo below 
	shows the scribe temporarily in place.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG scribe in arm.heic" alt="The scribe sitting in the reamed hole in the pantograph arm" width="1475" height="1885">

<p>
	Finishing the scribe attachment was accomplished by aligning the scribe holder with 
	the scribe in place on the arm. A punch mark was made in one hole with a transfer 
	punch. The holder was removed and the punch mark was drilled and tapped for a 6-32 
	screw. The holder was attached to the arm with scribe and one screw, then punched for 
	the second hole. This second hole was drilled and tapped. Reattaching the holder to 
	the arm made for a too tight fit of the scribe, so the 1/4" reamer was used to 
	"true up" the holes allowing for a tight but sliding fit for the scribe. (Probably 
	should ream the holder and aluminum bar in one go.)
</p>

<p>
	The base and pivot need to be designed. The picture my pantograph is based on, shown 
	above, has an extension from the base and the pivot is somehow attached to this 
	extension. The extension sits on top of the base, where the material to be engraved 
	sits. The pivot shaft could either be attached to the extension by a screw running 
	through the extension and into the shaft or the pivot shaft could be 
	threaded, screwed through the extension and secured with a locknut underneath the 
	extension. In my design the extension will be attached to a corner of the base as 
	opposed to an edge, providing more room for the piece to be engraved.
</p>

<p>
	The arm will be surmounted by brass blocks, above and below, through which the pivot 
	shaft will run. This will insure the rather heavy and extended pantograph will 
	not rock on the pivot. Washers will be used to establish the height of the 
	pantograph above the base. The pantograph was reassembled and measured, the distance 
	from scribe to pivot is approximately 10" - 27", closed to mostly open, though most 
	of the time the engraver will be about 7" - 10" from the pivot putting the scribe 14" 
	away. The diagonal of the 12" square aluminum base is 17", providing plenty of room 
	to handle even the largest designs, but potentially interfering with the design 
	location. It might be worthwhile cutting off the bottom corner of the square base. 
	Plans for the pivot shaft, extension and base are sketched below. The entire apparatus 
	will be attached to a wooden base. No telling where I will store it when not in use!!

<p>
	A cutoff of 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2" aluminum bar was cut to 4" with a hacksaw and the 
	ends filed smooth. All burrs were removed. The extension was clamped to a corner of 
	the deburred 12" square aluminum plate and drilled with a F drill The bottom plate 
	was tapped 5/16-18. The extension holes were opened to 21/64" and deeply chamfered 
	for two screws. The extension mounted to the square plate is seen below.

<p>
	The first attempt to make the support for the pivot from 1" brass was not successful. 
	The width was sufficient for the screws, but not for the screw heads. A wider piece 
	of brass, 1&nbsp;1/8", will be used instead. The brass was cut from dwindling stock 
	and marked for a 1/2" hole 3/8" from one 1" long edge. This hole was drilled and 
	reamed to 1/2" with the last drilling and reaming done on the South Bend lathe. 
	Meanwhile a 5" length of drill rod was faced on both ends and one end reduced to 
	5/16" for 1/2". An undercut was made with a cutoff blade. The end was threaded 5/16-18 
	with some difficulty. The pivot shaft was inserted through the above drilled hole 
	and screwed into the aluminum extension. The threads must be crooked in either the 
	hole or on the shaft as the brass block does not sit straight! Pretty sure it is the 
	shaft with a slightly bent threaded section!
</p>

<p>
	The offending threaded bit was cut off and the shortened shaft was held in the 
	three jaw chuck on the South Bend lathe. The shaft was faced and 1/2" reduced to 
	5/16". This reduced section was single point threaded. Setting the gear box to the 
	correct B2 setting was challenging as the shifters did not want to move, but 
	eventually they were worried into the correct positions. A new threading tool was 
	set up and the threads were cut. About halfway through the handle controlling start 
	and stop came off. Luckily the pin inside did not jump too far away. I struggled 
	returning it to position so ended up just holding it tightly while turning and 
	cutting.  In the end threads were turned that nicely fit the hole in the aluminum 
	plate. The threading setup is shown below.
</p>

<p>
	The bored block of brass was marked, 3/16" in from the corners farthest from the 
	bored hole. Two through holes were drilled at these marks , 3/16" diameter. The bored 
	block was mounted on the shaft installed in the aluminum plate. One hole was 
	transferred, drilled and tapped. After remounting and putting a screw into this newly 
	tapped hole the second hole was transferred. This hole was also drilled and tapped 
	8-32. A photo of the mounted shaft is shown below.

<p class = "note">
	This project has been beset by machine difficulties. First, the mill has problems 
	with both y- and z-axes. The y-axis moves with a squeal, while the z-axis was 
	"bumping" when lowered and now the handle turns freely with no movement whatsoever. 
	The South Bend lathe now has a malfunctioning split nut handle. Projects will need 
	to be put on hold while I fix these recalcitrant machines.
</p>

<p>
	After reading a page in the South Bend lathe rebuild manual, fixing the half nut 
	cam lever was trivial, as the book pointed out the screw below it. Two hours were 
	spent repairing the mill z-axis, mostly because it is so difficult to get the mill 
	positioned for work. The entirety of the z-axis mechanism was removed after removing 
	the motor. The screw, the saddle nut and the lock were thoroughly cleaned as was the 
	vertical column and the motor mount. The problem was guessed to be the set screw 
	holding the screw to the column thrust bearing allowing the z-axis screw to shift 
	relative to the handle. The part of the screw shaft where this set screw bites is 
	pretty worn. On the other hand the screw and the saddle nut were in great condition. 
	All is now good and the reduced backlash was programmed into the DRO. On to the final 
	part of the pantograph, the arm's brass supports for the pivot shaft.
</p>

<p>
	The plan for making these supports, one above and one below the arm, is as follows. 
	Two 1/4" thick brass blocks will be made with two through holes each. They will 
	be mounted on the arm. The arm will be held in the milling accessory on the South 
	Bend lathe. The lathe will be used to drill and ream the 1/2" hole through all three 
	parts, producing the perfect fit for the pivot shaft.
</p>

<p>
	Two 1&nbsp;1/4" lengths of 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" brass bar were cut from a scrap. Both 
	were cleaned up in the mill and deburred. The two blocks were clamped together in 
	the mill vise with a scrap of paper. They were center drilled and drilled 3/16" in 
	from two opposite corners with a #29 drill through. One block had the holes opened 
	to 0.177" and the other had the holes tapped 8-32. 
</p>

<p>
	The opened hole block was clamped to the aluminum bar so its center aligned with the 
	bars 12" mark, 12" from the hole at the opposite end. The two holes from the block 
	were transferred to the aluminum bar. These two marks were drilled through for the 
	8-32 screws. The photo below shows the two support blocks screwed to the aluminum 
	bar.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PNTG pivot support.heic" alt="The pivot support blocks mounted to the aluminum bar" width="2072" height="2402">

<p>
	With the support blocks in place the center of the support was marked and punched at 
	12". The bar was held in the South Bend milling accessory with a scrap of wood behind 
	it. After aligning the headstock with this punched mark the brass was center drilled. 
	It was then drilled with a 31/64" drill followed by reaming with a 1/2" reamer. The 
	three photos below document this process as well as a shot of the bar on the pivot 
	shaft. It spins freely as desired, but with no slop. It is time to take it apart, 
	clean it up, and assemble the finished pantograph.

<p>
	The four shafts for bar connection were individually returned to the lathe and 
	given a quick sanding with 600 grit sandpaper. All 3/8" holes in the bars were 
	touched up with the reamer. All of the brass and aluminum parts were sanded with 
	a gray Scotch pad. The parts <em>sans</em> base are shown in the photo below.
</p>

<p>
	That actually is not all of the parts as the bits for holding the calipers are not 
	included. In any event the pantograph went together reasonably easily. It can be 
	seen in the photo below. What cannot be seen is the ease and precision of movement. 
	A wooden base needs to be made for bolting the plate down and the pantograph will 
	soon be complete. (Also a spacer for holding the pantograph higher on the pivot shaft 
	needs to be made and an additional set screw needs to be made as one is needed to 
	lock the flex-shaft holder in place.)
</p>

<p>
	On this very hot first day of fall one of the last parts to be made is the wooden 
	base. An 18"&nbsp;X&nbsp;33&nbsp;1/2" rectangle of 3/4" particle board was cut from 
	stock with the circular saw. Two 7/8" holes were drilled partway through the 
	base board with a 7/8" Forstner bit to provide relief for the lock nuts on the 
	backside of the aluminum. The aluminum was marked for three holes 1" in from each of 
	the unused corners. These holes were transferred to the base board before deeply 
	chamfering. The three transfer marks were drilled (3/64" under thread size) for a 
	threaded insert, which was easily installed. The photo below shows the aluminum 
	square attached to the wooden base.
</p>

<p>
	The last parts, pivot spacers, were quickly made this morning. A 2&nbsp;1/2" length 
	of 5/8" round brass bar was cut from stock and held a collet in the South Bend lathe. 
	It was faced on both ends. This was followed by drilling and reaming to 1/2". This 
	tube was cut into three sections by parting off: 1/2", 3/4", and 1" lengths. The 
	parts were deburred and are shown below. The second photo shows the completed 
	pantograph with the 1" spacer installed.
