<p class=first>
	It is time to start a new chapter in the orrery etching saga. To wrap up the last 
	installment the challenge was not the etching <em>per se</em> but the ink transfer 
	to the brass. The best reference I found on the web implied that it was necessary 
	to not only apply heat, but also pressure. In addition a significant amount of 
	experimentation is required to get your results to be consistent. The biggest problem 
	I had each time a transfer was attempted was spots of ink that did not transfer. 
	When I attempted to apply pressure by bearing down on the iron the transfer was good 
	on one side and poor on the other. I attribute this to uneven pressure.
</p>

<p>
	I decided to make a jig that would hold the heat and apply the needed pressure to 
	the part. I will need a pretty large jig eventually to transfer ink to the dodecagon, 
	but a smaller version should suffice for the experimentation phase. A 
	1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3" steel plate was found in the bin. A 
	1/4&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/4" bar was also located. Four holes were drilled #29 and 
	tapped 8-32 in the plate. They were drilled 1/4" from one edge and 1&nbsp;3/16" from 
	the orthogonal edge. These holes were transferred to a piece of the bar that was cut 
	off with a hacksaw at 3" long. The four holes in the bar were drilled with a #10 
	drill. After cleaning up both parts four screws were put through the plate. These 
	screws were locked in place with four nuts. The bar was put in place and four more 
	nuts were put on the screws to add clamping pressure to anything between the bar and 
	the plate. The picture below shows the completed jig. A piece of brass is barely 
	visible between the bar and plate.
</p>

<img class=inline src="etchO3/Pressure jig 1.jpg" alt="The first heat/pressure jig" width="2055" height="1348">

<p>
	The recommended temperature is 140-150&deg; C or 284-302&deg; F. It should be easy 
	enough to heat up the grill to 300&deg;, place the jig into the grill for 10-15 
	minutes, remove it, and clamp in a piece of brass with an inked piece of acetate 
	taped on. The grill was heated to 300&deg;. This meant only the center burner was 
	on and the center knob was set at about 3:45 or covering the fifth bar. The jig 
	was placed in the grill where it sat for 15 minutes. The jig was removed and the brass 
	was placed in the center of the jig. The jig was tightened and placed back in the 
	grill. After two minutes the brass was removed from the jig and laid next to the grill 
	to cool. When it was cool to the touch (the jig was still hot) the tape was removed. 
	The picture below shows the result. It is a very uniform coating of ink. There are, 
	however, spots where no ink transferred. The brass was cleaned with acetone just 
	prior to taping on the acetate. Could it be dust particles on the printout?
</p>

<img class=inline src="etchO3/Pressure transfer 1.jpg" alt="The first heat/pressure jig transfer result" width="1396" height="628">

<p>
	A second attempt after dusting the acetate and the brass with a small paintbrush 
	went similarly to the first. The picture below shows that there are fewer spots 
	where ink did not transfer. However, the center of the transfer did not go well. 
	This may be a result of clamping only at the ends of the part or I may not have 
	tightened the nuts enough. I will make a third attempt with a machinists clamp in 
	the middle.
</p>

<img class=inline src="etchO3/Pressure transfer 2.jpg" alt="The second heat/pressure jig transfer result" width="1954" height="855">

<p>
	Third (or maybe 10th) time is a charm. This time both the jig and the machinist's 
	clamp were heated in the grill for 15 minutes. The brass with taped acetate was 
	inserted into the jig (ink side against the plate). The nuts were tightened and the 
	clamp was applied and also tightened. The whole was put into the grill for two 
	minutes. After removing the jig from the grill, the clamp was removed and the nuts 
	loosened. The brass was removed and allowed to cool sitting on the metal table. 
	The picture below shows the success! Few dots and sharp letters! Time to purchase 
	the plate for the full size jig. In the meantime there are other parts of the orrery 
	that need work as well.
</p>

<p>
	Upon further study of the orrery I realized that the top dodecagon cannot be flipped 
	over to use the backside for etching. The central bar is attached on the bottom and 
	it is not symmetric as it has two holes. One is offset from center. This hole supports 
	the driving gear stack and is offset to provide room for the worm. Etching the top of 
	this dodecagon where it has already been engraved will require a significant amount 
	of sanding. I had a dodecagon part that had the stars drilled into it. It took two 
	or three minutes of sanding to remove them. The thickness decreased from 0.188" to 
	about 0.160". It was much quicker than expected using the belt sander. The dodecagon 
	currently has a coat of varnish that needs to be removed first so it won't clog the 
	sandpaper. The varnish was removed with acetone. The sanding went quite well. Two 
	sections were sanded at a time, because two were on the belt at a time. After 
	about 15 minutes of sanding the engraving, stars and most of the division lines were 
	removed as shown in the picture below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="etchO3/Engraving sanded off.jpg" alt="After sanding off the engraving" width="2225" height="1851">

<p>
	Sanding out the 80-grit scratches was challenging. I tried the detail sander with 
	150 grit and then the random orbit sander with 150 grit. They got rid of about 80% 
	of the scratches. The rest were removed by hand with 150 grit paper. Worked up a 
	sweat and there are many grits to go! This morning started with more sanding. The 
	sanding began with 220, 320, and 400 grit paper. Each section took 75 to 100 strokes. 
	After a break I finished with 600, 1000, and 1500 grit paper. I don't have any 2000 
	or that would have been used as well. The back was also sanded, but only to 600 grit. 
	The dodecagon was then polished on the buffer with red rouge. After cleaning with 
	soap and water there are a few spots on the top (especially around the holes) that 
	need further polishing. The bottom was also polished and it has more rough spots 
	remaining than the top, but is not bad. A photo of the top of the dodecagon at this 
	preliminary polish stage is below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="etchO3/Polished dodec 1.jpg" alt="Dodecagon after sanding and polishing" width="1653" height="1687">

<p>
	All of the parts of the orrery need to be polished (or repolished). I removed the 
	columns as a sample of what needs to be done. The first column I started polishing 
	started turning blue when polishing. I assumed I had put varnish on it. I cleaned all 
	four columns with acetone. I then polished one of the columns. There was a lot of 
	the black gunk left on the column after polishing. This was washed off with soap and 
	water. A brush was used to get into the corners at the base and top. The photo below 
	shows the difference between the polished and unpolished columns.
</p>

<img class=inline src="etchO3/Polished column.jpg" alt="Column after and polishing" width="1863" height="1672">

<p>
	There is no point to polishing now unless the parts are painted with the new varnish, 
	before they tarnish. Once I have some experience I will be in a position to polish, 
	etch as needed, clean, and varnish each part. The Protecta-Clear from 
	<a href="https://www.everbritecoatings.com">Everbrite</a> application instructions 
	are quite clear and forceful: polish, neutralize, solvent wipe, and apply coating. 
	The polished column was neutralized with Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. About 1/4 cup 
	was dissolved in 1.5 cups of water. The column was rinsed and then dried with a clean 
	paper towel. Isopropyl alcohol was used as the solvent wipe. The column was set on 
	aluminum foil. The varnish was painted on with a small natural bristle brush. Using 
	very light strokes any bubbles could be easily removed. The coating is very smooth. 
	Very little running was observed on the vertical column. The second coat was applied 
	after one hour. The column was already dry to the touch. It now needs 4-5 days to 
	fully cure. I will need to set up a cleaning and painting station on the workbench to 
	do all of the various parts. (The brush was cleaned with acetone as mineral spirits 
	did not work.)
</p>

<p>
	The process was repeated on the other three columns, the four feet, and the four caps. 
	All of these pieces were polished with red rouge on the cloth wheel. They were then 
	thoroughly cleaned with soap and water using a brush as needed to remove the black 
	stuff from the polishing. They were then neutralized with the Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> 
	solution and rinsed. Finally, isopropanol was used to dry and completely degrease. (I 
	was wearing gloves the entire time.) A jig was made to hold the caps for painting. 
	All of the parts were given two coats of the varnish. The photo below shows these 
	parts immediately after the first coat of varnish was applied.
</p>

<p>
	Decided to etch some quotes and a signature/date in the bottom dodecagon. Three 
	quotes were selected: "I've never been to Mars, but I imagine it is quite lovely." 
	Kramer, "Time is a game played beautifully by children." Heraclitus, "Astronomy, as 
	nothing else can do, teaches men humility." Clarke. These three quotes are arranged 
	around the dodecagon. The signature, Jhmiii, and the date, 2020, span the crank 
	side of the dodecagon. This image was created in a file "images/Dodecagon 
	bottom.idraw". It was saved as a printable version in iCloud/Files for etching/
	Dodecagon bottom.png. Once I etch this I need to finish before the end of 2020!!
</p>

<p>
	The upper cross brace was selected for finishing next. As it had been previously 
	polished it was sanded with 1500 grit paper to remove tarnish. It was then polished 
	on the brass wheel. It was cleaned, neutralized, and degreased as above. A painting 
	jig was made for it. The four homemade transfer punches used to transfer the column 
	positions from one dodecagon to another were placed in holes drilled in two 
	pieces of wood. This is shown in the photo below after painting the first coat of 
	varnish on the cross brace. Two coats of varnish were applied. This varnish is very 
	nice to work with. It takes a little effort to remove the bubbles with light touches 
	of the brush. It flows well and dries smooth.
</p>

<img class=inline src="etchO3/Cross brace jig.jpg" alt="Top cross brace on its painting jig" width="1104" height="1120">

<p>
	Twelve parts were selected for polishing next. These were the three bearing blocks, 
	the handle and knob, the bottom cross brace, three bearings, the coupling, and the 
	two cross brace supports. They were sanded as needed and then polished. This was 
	followed by the three step cleaning process. A number of jigs were used to hold the 
	parts for painting. The first photo below shows the parts to be polished and the 
	second shows the parts after their first coat of varnish.

<p>
	The sun was varnished this morning. It was first polished and took on a nice shine 
	even with the "rough" finish. The same cleaning process was used and the first 
	coat of varnish went on smoothly. It is difficult to see the bubbles against the 
	rough background, but I believe I removed most of them. A picture of the sun still 
	wet with the first coat of varnish is included below.
</p>

<p>
	The parts need 4-5 days for the varnish to fully cure. I put them all in an old 
	whiskey box to keep them clean. They will sit there with the box open until I am 
	sure they are all cured. A photo of the polished and varnished parts is shown below. 
</p>

<p>
	The steel plates for the larger hot press arrived a few days ago. They were 
	clamped together with two machinist's clamps and holes were marked: 2" and 4" in 
	from the corners. The marks were punched and then drilled through with a #7 tap 
	drill. The clamps were removed and the bottom plate was drilled for clearance with 
	a 9/32" drill. The smaller holes were tapped 1/4-20. All holes were lightly 
	chamfered. The pair of plates is very heavy: a great heat reservoir. The hot press 
	is pictured below. (Pair of future pizza stones.)

<p>
	I have gone back to the printouts and have had problems getting them printing the 
	correct size. I finally found a path forward with pdfs. The pdfs and the pngs of 
	the dodecagon frames would not print out on multiple pages and they are two big at 
	100% for one page!  So I broke the image into pieces These parts are all in the 
	iCloud folder. I then went back to the png for the planet rings. Again the sizes are 
	not correct. I tried Graphic again to remind myself why it did not work forcing me to 
	learn SVG. The problem is that when placing text around a circle it can no longer be 
	flipped to a mirror image. Flipping it only moves it to the other side of the path. 
	In addition flipped text (so its a mirror image) when placed around the circle 
	reverts to regular direction text on the inside of the circle.
</p>

<p>
	I thought of a possible work around. What if I export the text as an image and then 
	bring it back in. Would I be able to flip that image? The program even has a menu 
	item to facilitate this: Edit/Copy As... . One can save a selection to the clipboard 
	as png, pdf, or svg. I tried png but the resolution was poor. However, svg worked 
	well. Once pasted back in the svg image could be flipped to give mirror image text 
	around a circle. An early version with two rings was exported to pdf. This was 
	opened in preview and it printed perfectly!!!
</p>

<p>
	There are now ten files to print: three for the upper dodecagon, four for the lower 
	dodecagon, and one each for the planet rings and the equation of time. Nine of these 
	files are pdfs and one (EOT) is png format. All of these files are in my iCloud 
	folder, "Files for etching". I described this problem to Rhea and she came up with an 
	excellent solution to the size issue. Print them at home where I can control the 
	size and just have them copied onto the acetates at OfficeDepot!!!!! Just returned 
	from making the copies. All went pretty smoothly. Twice acetates stuck together, so 
	only two copies of two designs. Three copies were made of the other seven. They all 
	look a little dusty. I will need to spend some time brushing them off prior to 
	attempting the transfer.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom dodecagon frame was the first transfer attempted. The frame was first 
	sanded with 600 to 1500 grit paper to remove the tarnish. It was then polished with 
	red rouge on the cloth wheel. The frame was washed with soapy water, dried and rinsed 
	with acetone. The four pieces of acetate were cut out, brushed for dust, and taped 
	(masking tape) to the dodecagon. The massive press was taken out to the grill and 
	heated at 300&deg; for 15 minutes. It was removed from the grill with the use of the 
	screws. The top was removed and the dodecagon was placed acetate side down onto the 
	bottom plate. The top plate was replaced and the nuts (not heated) were threaded onto 
	the screws and tightened. The press was returned to the hot grill for two minutes. 
	The press was pulled out of the grill and the nuts were removed. The top was pulled 
	off freeing the frame. After cooling for ten minutes on the aluminum table the tape 
	was removed with the help of a piece of wood. The transfer was quite disappointing. 
	As can be seen in the picture below the transfer was spotty. I am guessing this is 
	due to uneven pressure. The brass and steel are not perfectly flat. Consequently, 
	pressure is applied only in certain areas. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="etchO3/Transfer 1.jpg" alt="The completed hot press" width="1628" height="1693">

<p class="note">
	There were multiple challenges using the press besides the poor transfer. Grabbing 
	the two plates by their edges is difficult especially when hot. The press needs a 
	handle. Second, putting on and removing the screws takes about one minute. This is 
	too long. Third, the plates, when separated, get turned and will not go back together 
	until they are rotated to the correct position. The insides also need to be matched. 
	Some marks on the plates need to be added to facilitate reassembly. Finally, when 
	the top plate was removed after heating, the dodecagon frame was stuck to the top plate. 
	The glue from the tape must have leaked out. This only becomes an issue, if there is 
	nothing available to pry the frame loose.
</p>

<p>
	I assumed the tape was sufficient to make up for any gaps between the frame and the 
	steel. Clearly this is not the case. I am not quite sure what to use to more evenly 
	distribute the pressure around the dodecagon. I did not completely tighten the center 
	four screws before putting the dodecagon back into the grill. I was trying to minimize 
	time off of the grill. This may have also contributed to the uneven pressure. Some 
	hard foam would be ideal to place behind the frame. I do not know what kinds of foam 
	will hold up to 300&deg;.
</p>

<p>
	A second transfer attempt was made today. The same strips of acetate used in the 
	first transfer attempt were reused. They were taped on as before. The differences 
	this time were the press was heated for 30 minutes. The screws were tightened as far 
	as they would go. The press with brass was left in the oven for five minutes. The 
	tape was then removed after cooling the brass. There was significantly more ink 
	transfer. But, there were still spots that had little transfer. I think this means 
	that sufficient pressure can be applied with the screws. The pressure, however, is 
	not applied evenly across the brass even though it was aligned pretty evenly with 
	the screws. I don't think I need a lot of packing to transfer the pressure evenly. 
	Possibly a piece of poster board or similar might do the trick.
</p>

<p>
	The thickness of the brass dodecagon was measured at three sites per side. This data 
	is plotted in the following graph. It is difficult to understand how a 1-3 thou would 
	make such a difference. The steel sheets are very flat unlike the hot rolled steel 
	used for the small press. A thin sheet of cardboard should fill those small gaps and 
	hopefully lead to full ink transfer. Time to test the hypothesis.

	Two sheets of thin cardboard were used to make the spacer. They were each cut to fit 
	half of the press. They were clamped to the top of the press and the holes were 
	marked with a punch. The sheets were also marked for correct orientation relative to 
	each other and to the press. The holes were then drilled 5/16", clearance. The sheets 
	fit nicely over the screws in the bottom plate with minimal gap between them. The 
	picture below shows the sheets in place on the screws.
</p>

<p>
	A third transfer attempt was undertaken this morning. Various pieces for printout were 
	used for this trial. Some were parts of planet rings from a previous printing. Just 
	two pieces of tape were used for each section to minimize different thicknesses across 
	the section. The press was heated to 300&deg; for 30 minutes. The dodecagon was put in 
	place and the cardboard was placed on top of the dodecagon. The top was put in place 
	and screwed tightly to the bottom. The press was then put back into the grill for 
	four minutes. The press was removed. The nuts were removed and the top was lifted off. 
	The cardboard was pulled off and the dodecagon was pried loose from the bottom. It 
	was left to cool for ten minutes. The tape was removed. All but one of the sections 
	had complete transfer, i.e., the acetate had no remaining ink. There was, however, 
	a lot of ink flow. This can be seen in the photo below. The three sections 
	that used a previous printout of the planet rings flowed the most. There were no 
	visible letters on those sections. With the assembly and tightening, the ink was 
	heated for 7-9 minutes.
</p>

<img class=inline src="etchO3/Transfer 3.jpg" alt="The results of the third transfer" width="1457" height="1727">

<p>
	There was only one layer of tape used in this trial, where there have been two. That 
	could be responsible for the flow. The thinner tape may have also helped give a 
	complete transfer. The only places that did not transfer were the ends of the sections 
	where there was no tape. So the cardboard did not make up for the thickness of the 
	tape. The assembly and nut tightening process can probably not be completed any faster. 
	The whole assembly could be left on the grill for a shorter time. The transfer worked 
	very well on a small scale. The factor responsible for failure upon scale-up is not 
	clear. It is probably lack of control of the heating/pressing time. A smaller press 
	could be used and the dodecagon could be done section by section. It is less clear 
	how the planet rings would be done in a small press.
</p>

<p>
	Another transfer attempt failed. Repeated the process above but deliberately tried 
	to minimize the setup time. After heating the press it was removed and the brass 
	dodecagon was put in place. The top was put on and the screws tightened. It was 
	returned to the grill for one minute. It was then removed from the grill, unscrewed, 
	and the brass was set on the aluminum table to cool. The total time from taking the 
	press out of the grill after pre-warming to setting the dodecagon on the table was 
	eight minutes. After cooling to just warm the tape was removed and the transfer 
	inspected. The transfer was not complete, maybe 90%. Nearly all of the transferred 
	ink had run. Only one or two of the letters were not fuzzy. So much for using this 
	large press to transfer ink to the dodecagons. 
</p>

	I will attempt a transfer to the Mars planet ring. The thinner metal may make a 
	difference. I won't use the screws, but just stand on the press for one or two minutes. 
	The Mars planet ring would be difficult to do in pieces, that is why it has been 
	chosen. The ring was sanded with 1000 and 1500 grit sandpaper. It was then polished 
	with red rouge. It was cleaned with soap and water followed by an acetone wipe. A 
	printed Mars circle was cut out of the acetate and taped to the ring. There are a 
	number of bubbles that, with luck, will be pressed flat by the hot press. The spots 
	where the bubbles are were marked to see if they correspond to any differences in 
	transferring. The bubbles are due to cutting the acetate ring just a tad larger than 
	the brass ring. The tape pushes the extra acetate in creating a bubble.
</p>

<p>
	The press was heated to 300&deg; for the now standard 30 minutes. It was removed and 
	separated. The ring was laid on the bottom followed by the cardboard and the top. 
	The whole press was set on the patio, blocks were laid out on top and I stepped up 
	on it for two minutes. Since I knew the pressure would mostly be on two sides of the 
	ring, I placed the ring so the gaps between the two quotes would be at the top and 
	bottom. Then when standing with my feet on the sides, most of the pressure was focused 
	on the quotes. The top was removed and the brass ring was placed on the table to cool. 
	After removing the tape (pain in the ass!) the transfer was exposed. It was a mixed 
	result. There certainly was reasonable transfer. The bubbles did have a negative 
	effect inhibiting transfer in their vicinity. The transfer was also spotty. On the 
	positive side the letters were all well formed. I have attempted to capture this in 
	the following photo. One way to avoid the bubbles would be to tape in both directions 
	from a starting point. When the tape has reached the opposite side the ring can be 
	cut to release any extra prior to completing the taping. The hot press needs to go 
	longer. Three or four minutes should be about right.

<p>
	It is now August 2 and time for another experiment. While the press heated I cut out 
	and taped another copy of the Mars ring onto the brass. This time care was taken to 
	cut the ring slightly narrower than the ring and to minimize bubbles while taping the 
	acetate was cut into two parts. 
	Since there was incomplete transfer the last time, the brass ring was heated for 
	three minutes. I stood on two wooden blocks to transfer pressure mostly over the 
	brass. The paper insert was used to even the pressure. After removal and cooling the 
	tape was removed. A very disappointing result. As can be seen in the pictures below 
	some areas transfered well and sharply, though spots where no transfer took place 
	can also be seen. What is worse is the areas where the ink ran. Some of these are 
	adjacent to sharp letters!!!

<p>
	Another attempt was made this morning. Clearly the pressure has not been consistent 
	across the ring, so the transfer is spotty. I decided to drop back a bit and only do 
	part of the ring. So the previous attempt was cleaned off with acetone. A new acetate 
	ring was cut out. Only one half of this acetate ring was used. This quote covers 
	slightly less than half of the Mars ring. Four C-clamps were found, two are deep 
	enough to reach almost to the ends of the acetate. The top plate was marked where 
	the clamps should go. The press was heated to 300&deg; for 30 minutes. The acetate 
	was taped onto the brass ring. The press was removed from the grill and the brass 
	ring was placed on the press with one edge aligned with the edge of the press. The 
	top was put on and the clamps were applied. It probably took about 15 seconds to get 
	the clamps on and tightened. The clamps were left on for 2&nbsp;1/2 minutes. They were 
	quickly removed and the brass ring was removed from the press. After cooling the 
	tape was removed. Peeling the acetate off revealed probably the best transfer yet. 
	As can be seen in the following picture the transfer was homogeneous across the 
	entire span. The press was clamped too long as can be seen from the flow and fuzzy 
	letters. Again though, this was consistent across the length of the quote. Presumably, 
	if the time is reduced to maybe 1&nbsp;3/4 minutes there will be transfer without 
	flow. (Notice the two lines where the adjacent tape was not aligned well.)

<p>
	Another attempt at 1&nbsp;3/4 minutes still ran some, but not as much as previously. 
	Maybe 1&nbsp;1/4 minutes or only one minute, might work. I am out of the correct 
	Mars ring quotes, so I will need to prepare another planet ring for tests. The Earth 
	ring was selected. It was polished. During the polishing I explored a few things. 
	An obvious improvement was longer polishing time. This removes fine scratches from 
	the sandpaper. The last process was repeated with a one minute clamping time, plus 
	a little before for clamping and a little at the end for unclamping. The results were 
	disappointing. As can be seen in the picture below. the transfer was great in places, 
	non-existent in places and even a little blurring in places.

<p>
	Even if I were to get a transfer to work, there will be no reproducibility. I am 
	completely stumped. Nearly all of the videos on YouTube that discuss transfers use 
	heat and pressure. However, I did find one from an 
	<a "href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PND-FpcGru8">engraver</a>. He used a 
	completely different approach. He printed onto parchment paper. He affixed the 
	parchment paper to the metal (steel in his case) and wet the back of the parchment 
	paper with acetone from a Q-tip. He rubbed the parchment paper with the back of a 
	spoon. You could watch the ink leave the parchment paper as he rubbed it. When 
	finished a very detailed design had been transferred to the steel in preparation 
	for engraving. In order to print on the parchment paper with a laser printer he 
	taped the parchment paper fragment to regular paper. I assume this is so the paper 
	has enough stiffness to be pulled into the printer. Rhea will order parchment paper 
	from Kroger for pick up tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
	Got the parchment paper. I took printouts and parchment paper to Office Depot. The 
	less than adequate printer jammed on the first page. I spoke with Erin and she 
	agreed to try it on her printer at work. I took a whole package of printouts and 
	parchment paper to her. I picked a few of the better printouts this morning. This 
	afternoon I tried them out. The transfer was simple enough with a couple of caveats. 
	No acetone can get under the printout as that dissolves the ink. So a wide margin, 
	1/4", needs to surround the area to be transferred. The acetone needs to soak in a 
	little before rubbing. I found rubbing with the edge of the spoon with significant 
	pressure gave the most uniform transfer. Unfortunately, the ink in the final product 
	is just not dense enough. I am sure it is fine for engraving, but not for etching. 
	The picture below captures the "grainy" coverage.

<p>
	I thought back to my etching class at the Indianapolis Art Center many years ago. I 
	still have a few notes. In that class we used blue "PnP" paper. I looked up PnP paper 
	on the web and discovered one company that sells the stuff: Techniks Press and Peel. 
	They sell it for circuit board makers. The PnP paper has some blue coating on one 
	side that is printed on and releases the ink upon ironing. I purchased a package of 
	twenty sheets for $40 with shipping. The PnP paper arrived today. 
</p>

<p>
	I went back to the various pdfs, pngs and idraw images I have saved over the many 
	iterations of this project. For each item (or part of an item) I copied the image in 
	Preview from the png, pasted it into Graphic, scaled it as needed, multiplied the 
	image, and exported it back to a png file. The only one I did not go through this 
	process for was the planet rings as they already fill a page. The PnP is expensive 
	so that is why I want multiple images on each page. This produced nine files that I 
	will either print here and copy on PnP or print on PnP at Office Depot.
</p>

<p>
	The files were printed here and the resulting nine pages and nine pages of PnP were 
	taken to Office Depot yesterday. For $1.28 I got the copies printed onto PnP with a 
	laser printer. Unfortunately, the guy doing the copying did not copy one of the pages 
	and I will need to return to get the last one printed on PnP, if I can get this to 
	work.
</p>

<p>
	I am convinced that the problem lies in heating the metal evenly and to the correct 
	temperature. The PnP instructions specify 275&deg; to 325&deg; temperature for the 
	iron. They say this is between "acrylic" and "polyester" on most irons. Using an 
	iron to transfer from PnP to a 1/16" thick sheet of metal should be straightforward. 
	The iron should be able to heat the metal that is only this thick. The thicker frame 
	parts on the other hand need a different approach. I think these parts need to be 
	preheated to 200&deg; to 250&deg; before applying the iron.
</p>

<p>
	Two attempts were made this morning. The PnP was cut around a frame quote leaving 
	3/16" of plastic around the ink. The corners were removed so the extra would fold 
	up the sides. The sides were creased along the edge of the ink. This was then placed 
	on the frame and held with masking tape on the back side. The grill was heated to 
	235&deg; and the frame with PnP was placed on the pizza stone for 7 minutes. The 
	iron was turned on. Unfortunately, the only setting below "wool" is "synthetic silk". 
	I guessed and picked a setting on the low side. After ironing for 3 minutes the brass 
	was quenched in running water. I took a look under one end of the PnP. There was no 
	transfer whatsoever. The brass was returned to the grill for 7 minutes and the temp 
	of the iron was increased. After ironing for four minutes the brass was cooled with 
	water and the PnP was removed. The picture below shows this first attempt. The second 
	picture shows how the PnP is taped to the brass.

<p>
	Two things were changed for the second attempt. The grill was heated to 250&deg; 
	and the iron was set between "wool" and "synthetic silk". The picture shows some 
	good transfer, but some poor transfer as well. The third attempt went for even more 
	heat. The gril was heated to 275&deg; and the iron was set at "wool". Care was taken 
	during ironing to iron each of the three segments individually for 1-2 minutes. After 
	cooling with water the tape and plastic were removed. Pretty successful. Still a few 
	glitches, but I expect this to improve with practice.
</p>

<p>
	I decided to switch to a plate to be etched for the sun clock. It is on 1/32" thick 
	brass. This should be easier to heat to the appropriate temperature. The plate was 
	heated to 275&deg; on the grill (needed two burners on low as the temp outside was 
	about 55&deg;) for five minutes. The plate was first scrubbed with #00 steel wool 
	per instructions and cleaned with soap and water. The plate was removed from the 
	grill and placed on a board. The image was laid on the plate and a sheet of paper 
	was laid on top. With the iron set at the 'l' in 'wool' it was rubbed across the 
	plate for 3 minutes. The first image below shows the result. Not great. The second 
	attempt had a few changes. The plate was heated to 300&deg; and the iron was set at 
	the 'w' in 'wool'. The iron was held on the plate for five minutes. The second 
	picture shows the drastic improvment. A third attempt was made. The grill was a little 
	hotter, 315&deg; and pressure was used on the iron. This plate (third photo below) 
	turned out worse than the previous plate completely confusing me. Maybe the entire 
	ironing process needs to take place with the brass plate on the hot steel plate.

<p>
	After a two month delay I am refocusing on etching. The obstacle posed by using 
	already heated plates and brass is bubbles. No amount of scraping with a credit card 
	would remove the bubbles. They seem to be trapped! A potential way around this latest 
	obstacle is by rolling the printout onto the heated brass. To this end a roller needs 
	to be made.
</p>

<p>
	Six inches of 1" steel hex was chucked in the Sherline. It was center drilled and 
	faced using a half tailstock center. It was then turned down to 1" diameter except 
	for the end held in the chuck. The end was drilled and reamed to 5/16" for a 1" 
	depth. This work was really beyond the limits of the Sherline. I should have used 
	the South Bend, but it was below freezing this morning. The work was flipped and 
	center drilled. It was faced and the remaining hex was reduced to the 1" diameter. 
	Finally, this second end was drilled and reamed to 5/16" for 1". A final pass on 
	the South Bend was needed along with sanding to get a smooth finish.
</p>

<p>
	Two handles were made. Two 2" lengths of 3/8" steel hex were cut with the hacksaw. 
	They were individually held in the chuck and faced. Each part was reduced to 5/16" 
	for 1". The parts were flipped and reduced to 0.25" for 3/4" and then threaded 1/4-20. 
	This left a small section of hex. Wooden handles were made from walnut. Two 3"X5/8"X5/8" 
	lengths were cut on the table saw. They were drilled on one end 3/4" deep with a #7 
	drill and threaded 1/4-20. After chamfering the corners and minimal sanding all parts 
	were finished. A picture below shows the completed roller.
</p>

<p>
	Tried the roller out today. The grill was heated to 300&deg; with roller and brass 
	dodecagon. The pizza stone was removed with the roller and dodecagon and set on wood 
	on the patio table. A strip of transfer material was held on one end against the 
	dodecagon. Rhea used the roller to press the transfer paper onto the dodecagon, while 
	I held the other end up. The roller-transfer paper combination was too slippery and 
	the roller did not roll. It also did not stick or transfer any of the blue ink. A 
	second attempt was immediately tried. I used the roller more as a scraper and just 
	pushed the roller along the transfer paper. This one actually transfered reasonably 
	well.
</p>

<p>
	A few takeaways: the roller did not roll, the transfer paper did not immediately 
	stick to the dodecagon, just pressing the hot roller against the transfer did 
	transfer pretty well, and it was a challenge aligning the transfer paper with the 
	dodecagon. Getting the initial end aligned and pressed down is a necessity. The hot 
	roller then works pretty well. This might work if initiation can be routinely done 
	well.
