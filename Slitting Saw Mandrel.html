<p class=first>
	I needed a mandrel for the slitting saw. Built it with the previously made 3/8-24 
	arbor in mind. The key to making this run true is to mount it on the arbor for 
	all finishing operations on the lathe.
</p>

<img class=inline src="slitSawMan/Slitting Saw Mandrel.tiff" alt="Slitting Saw Mandrel Body" width="830" height="358">

<p>
	Cut off a 1 1/4" length of 1" steel rod that was already faced and center drilled. 
	Drilled with #O drill bit to a depth of 9/16" and tapped  it 3/8-24. This was then 
	mounted on the arbor, held in the end mill holder, and mounted to the lathe. The 
	steel was faced and turned true for its length. The first 1/16" was reduced to 5/8" 
	for a tight fit to the slitting saw. This same face was then center drilled, drilled 
	with a #21 drill bit, and tapped 10-32 for the retaining screw.
</p>

<img class=inline src="slitSawMan/SS Mandrel Cap.tiff" alt="Slitting Saw Mandrel Cap" width="521" height="343">

<p >
	The cap was made on the end of a 1" round steel bar. The bar was center drilled, and 
	drilled 7/32" for clearance on the 10-32 screw. This end was then bored to a depth 
	of 1/16" and diameter of 5/8" until it was a tight fit on the body. The cap was 
	cut off first with a parting blade and then with a hacksaw. The cap was mounted 
	on the body/arbor setup and faced and trued.
</p>
<p>
	The body/cap assembly was removed from the arbor and held in the vise on the mill. 
	Center was located by 2 passes with the edge finder. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	See the "Osborne Calculation Tool" listed on the left.
</p>

<p>
	The part was then offset by 5/16" and drilled with a spot drill. It was then 
	drilled 3/8" deep with a 1/8" bit. A reamer was used to ensure an accurate size. 
	A 3/16" long piece of round steel bar (1/8") was held in a collet in the lathe. It 
	was faced and then glued (Locktite) into the hole in the body. All pieces had a 
	nice fit with minimal movement of the blade when the cap was even loosely attached.
</p>

<p class=note>
	Made a similar mandrel for the gear cutters purchased from RDG Tools, but with a 
	square key glued into place. Runout on both mandrels with a cutting tool in place 
	was excessive. I was able to bring both down to respectable runout by careful filing. 
	The runout on the gear cutter is now < 0.001" and on the slitting saw < 0.002".
