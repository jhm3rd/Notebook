<p class=first>
	The Planetary Business Card project has convinced me it is time to make a slotting 
	attachment for the mill. It will be used for making the gears for this project. It 
	will also be useful for marking dials and other similar items. There is a good 
	description of making a slotting attachment for a large lathe in Machinist's 
	Workshop Aug/Sep 2010, pg 5 & Oct/Nov, pg 34. Its lever mechanism will ba adapted 
	for this slotter.
</p>

<p>
	The first order of business is deciding how to attach the device. The most flexibility 
	comes from attaching it to the z-axis. The rotary table, indexing head, and x- & 
	y-axes can then all be used as needed. My first plan was to mount it to the side of 
	the spindle head where the motor is mounted. This presents a potential problem of 
	torque as pressure is applied to the slotting lever and pushing the mill column out 
	vertical. The second idea was the winner. The attachment can just replace the 
	spindle altogether. This greatly simplifies the design. One block of material will 
	serve to anchor the device and support the leveraging mechanism without running 
	screw holes through the shaft hole.
</p>

<p>
	The block of material required for this main part of the slotter should be about 
	2&nbsp;1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2&nbsp;3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3". This is the approximate size of 
	the current spindle housing. A hole is needed for the ram and its bearings 
	sitting toward the front of the device. A large hole as well as a keyway are in the 
	back. One side has a threaded hole for a set screw. Dimensions were taken and the 
	main block was constructed in Fusion 360. The two pictures below show the results of 
	this CAD work.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA 3D render.png" alt="3D rendering of the body" width="850" height="970">
<img class=inline src="images/MSA plans.png" alt="Plans for the main body" width="1774" height="1466">

<p>
	The only aspect of the drawing that is a little off is the hole for the ram. Two 
	bronze or brass bearings will be inserted in the ends of this hole. They will be 
	bored 0.750". The hole between these two bearing seats should be larger than 0.750" 
	so the ram is supported only by the bearings. One additional feature may be added: 
	a second set screw into the center of the ram hole from the front of the block. With 
	a slot cut in the ram, this set screw could be used as a stop to cut precisely 
	measured lines as on a dial.
</p>

<p>
	Ordered the needed ingredients from Speedy Metals this afternoon.  In addition to 
	bronze for bushings, nylon 6/6 was also ordered. It will be tried as bushings to 
	determine if it is as good or better than bronze for this sliding action.The aluminum 
	block was ordered quite oversized (a 3" length of 2&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3") as that 
	is what was available. My current design is for a block 2&nbsp;1/8" wide. I also need 
	to add tabs to the top to support the lever mechanism. I called Speedy Metals to 
	modify my order. I should finish the design work before ordering! Back to Fusion  
	to add the tabs.
</p>

<p>
	The new and improved plans are shown below. The Fusion 360 work is proceeding much 
	more smoothly now. Repeating this exercise three times has been beneficial.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA top plan.png" alt="Plans for the main body" width="634" height="524">

<p>
	I would like for this to also be useful on the South Bend lathe. Consideration was 
	given to adding flanges on the back to it could be clamped to the crosslide table on 
	a support raising it to lathe center height. An easier alternative is mounting it 
	in the vertical milling attachment. Center height can easily be adjusted as needed. 
	I am considering putting multiple flats for the set screw that holds the cutting head 
	in place. This will allow easy adjustment of the cutting orientation whether attached 
	to the mill or in the lathe milling attachment.
</p>

<p>
	The simple 0.5"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1.0"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1.5" pivot link was created in Fusion 
	next. The 3D render and the plan are shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA pivot plan.png" alt="Plans for the pivot link" width="1282" height="574">

<p>
	The yoke is a little more complex. The depth of the cutout may need to be modified 
	as this is dependent on the distance between the ram and the tabs on the main body. 
	These are not the same in my model as in the article. The yoke attaches to the 
	handle. The handle in the article is made from 3/4" steel round. The handle here is 
	made from 1/2" steel round. Consequently the screw hole in the yoke is threaded 
	3/8-24.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA yoke plan.png" alt="Plans for the yoke pivot" width="1526" height="1150">

<p>
	The handle and ball were drawn next as shown in the four screen captures below.
</p>

<p>
	The ram and the tool holder. For the angled hole in the toolholder a sketch with a 
	circle was created on the face of the cylinder. Then a line was drawn from the center 
	of the circle to the opposite face at 10&deg;. Sweep was used instead of extrude by 
	selecting the circle and then the path (line).

<p>
	And finally the shoulder screws that are yet to be purchased, but needed to put the 
	model together. These were quickly drawn. No plan is shown as they are not being made. 
	I started working through the assembly. It is difficult as multiple things need to 
	be selected to get the joint to work. For instance an axis on a bolt along with the 
	face of the head need to be selected along with the hole and the appropriate buried 
	face where the head seats. Just aligning the picture so I can see the things that 
	need to be selected is challenging. The body and bolt were assembled first. This was 
	followed by adding the pivot. The yoke and the bolt for the pivot were assembled and 
	this was further joined to the other end of the pivot. The ram was joined to the 
	body and a problem was discovered.
</p>

<p class="note">
	I saw a video on assembly. The most noteworthy part of the video is selecting things 
	that are behind others. A modifier key held down during the selection process pops 
	up a list of selectable items behind the pointer.
</p>

<p>
	The ram does not align with the yoke as can be seen in the following screenshot. Of 
	course, this is exactly why I wanted to learn how to use Fusion 360. I prefer to spot 
	these errors before I cut metal. The hole for the ram needs to be moved to center it 
	between the two tabs. That runs the risk of the ram hole running into the mounting 
	hole. Lucky, lucky! The ram hole needs to be moved 3/16" and the distance between 
	the support hole and the shaft is 0.44". There is 1/4" to spare. <em>That assumes  
	the hole drilled for the support is finished flat bottomed with an end mill.</em> 
</p>

<p>
	The model was repaired in two places by going back to the original sketches and 
	editing them. The ram hole shifted, but the drawings did not reflect this change. 
	After many machinations I found a small chain icon in the application bar that drove 
	the update. The drawings above now reflect the modification. The joints are in place 
	as shown above, but I have not been able to get the last joint to form without 
	yanking the shoulder bolt out of the yoke. I have posted a query asking how to do 
	this on the <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-design-validate">
	Fusion 360 forum.</a> After a little back and forth someone modified the model I 
	posted and returned it. The animation shows good clearance between the top of the 
	ram and the yoke!

<p>
	Made the first part in the lathe this morning, the handle. Found some crummy CRS and 
	cut off an 8" length. It was held in the vise and a steady rest was positioned about 
	2" from the distal end. The free end was faced and 1/2" was reduced to 0.373". There 
	was tremendous chatter. The steady rest did not hold the part no matter how tight 
	its screws were turned. Thread relief was cut and all corners were chamfered. This 
	was repeated on the opposite end. The shaft was sanded to a decent finish, though 
	there are a lot of tiny divots and a line that runs the length. The first photo shows 
	the lathe setup and the second the rod after threading ends 3/8-24. The threads on 
	one end did not go on straight. That will be the handle end!
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA handle.jpg" alt="The handle completed with threaded ends" width="771" height="1331">

<p>
	A 2&nbsp;1/2" length of 1" aluminum rod was cut off and held in the three jaw chuck. 
	It was aligned with a dial indicator. The end was faced. (Too long for this chuck!) 
	The radius attachment was set up and a ball was cut on the end of the shaft. The 
	ball end was center drilled, drilled to "O", and tapped 3/8-24.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA ball setup.jpg" alt="The setup for turning the ball" width="1807" height="1906">
<img class=inline src="images/MSA ball tapped.jpg" alt="The ball threaed for the second half" width="1313" height="1624">

<p>
	The rod was cut off at 1&nbsp;1/8" from the drilled end. (Should have cut it closer 
	to size.) The shaft from the gear cutter holder was screwed into the ball end. This 
	was held in the 3/8" end mill collet for cutting the other hemisphere. This proceeded 
	until the 'ball' was more of an elongated ball. As the length was reduced a mistake 
	was made putting a groove in the ball. This became a feature. The ball was sanded to 
	1500 grit. It was then polished on the wheel with white compound. Finally, a coat of 
	paste wax was applied.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA ball polished.jpg" alt="The polished ball still on the arbor" width="1542" height="1475">

<p>
	A 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" piece of steel was found in the cutoff bin sized for the pivot. 
	A slightly greater than 1.5" length was cut off with the horizontal bandsaw. This piece 
	was clamped to an angle plate with two machinist's clamps. A square was used to make 
	sure the sawn edge would be cut square. The two flute cutter was used. After a few 
	cuts that chattered and left a poor finish, the two inserts were rotated to new 
	sharp corners. This made a world of difference. The cutting proceeded much more 
	smoothly. After one sawn end was cleaned up the other end was cleaned up and the 
	length reduced to 1.50". Cuts of 0.0075" were used to reduce the length and the final 
	cut was 0.005". Both ends were deburred. The final block of steel is 
	0.497"&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.995&nbsp;X&nbsp;1.502". 
</p>

<p>
	Drilling paralleled the just finished faces. The shorter length should then 
	sit easily between the two tabs on the base. One side (1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1") was 
	painted with Dykem and marked for two holes on center and separated by 1.000". The 
	holes were aligned with the spotting drill using the slip-on spud. After spot 
	drilling the holes were drilled with a 0.128" drill followed by an "A" drill. The 
	holes were reamed 0.250". The pivot at this stage is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA pivot drilled.jpg" alt="The pivot cut to length, drilled and reamed" width="1418" height="1527">

<p>
	The next step is cutting a radius on the ends. Prices of radius end mills that cut a 
	1/4" radius are astronomical. My plan is to make two cuts and leave a semi-octagon, 
	i.e., three	 faces on the end. A little math was in order. The internal angle of an 
	octagon is (8 - 2)*180/8 = 135&deg;. The side, <em>a</em>, of an octagon as a function 
	of the span, <em>S</em>, or diameter to a side is 
	<em>a</em> = <em>S</em> / (1 + &radic;2). The span is 0.5" so <em>a</em> = 0.207". The 
	height from the current rectangular end to the new face is <em>a</em>/2 = 0.103". So 
	the cut needs to be at a 45&deg; angle and cut to a depth of 0.103".
</p>

<p>
	So far I have been unable to hold the part tight enough to mill off the corner. The 
	first attempt was in the vise held on the angle table. The part was held firmly, but 
	the angle table projected the part so high off of the table there was tremendous 
	chatter and poor cutting. The next attempt was positioning it in the vise at a 45&deg; 
	angle. The vise was unable to hold the part tight enough. The third attempt was 
	holding the part against the angle plate with two machinist's clamps. This is shown 
	in the photo below. It is very difficult to get the machinist's clamps aligned for a 
	tight clamp. The part was not held sufficiently rigid.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA pivot clamping.jpg" alt="The pivot held to the angle plate at an angle" width="1626" height="1546">

<p>
	Another approach is making use of the holes. Putting pins or screws through the holes 
	anchored with a jig of some sort might be a more rigid means of holding the part. To 
	this end a scrap of 1/4" aluminum plate was squared up on two sides in the mill. A 
	hole was drilled with a #7 drill and tapped 1/4-20. A 1/4" screw was put through the 
	part and into the tapped hole. The jig was placed against a 1-2-3 block and the part 
	set at 45&deg;. The screw was tightened and the opposite hole was transferred to the 
	jig.This hole was aligned with the spud and spot drilled. This hole was also drilled 
	with a #7 drill followed by tapping. A 1&nbsp;1/4" length of 0.250" drill rod was 
	cut off and held in the collet in the lathe. One end was faced and the part flipped. 
	The other end was faced and threaded 1/4-20. It was necessary to do the threading 
	in the vise as it was very tough to thread. The photo below shows the finished jig.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA pivot jig.jpg" alt="The jig to hold the pivot at an angle dor milling" width="1647" height="1415">

<p>
	The jig worked like a champ! It held the part as solid as a rock. The first picture 
	below shows the cutting in progress. The flats were cut until the width was about 
	3/16" + 1/64" or a little over 0.200". This did not correspond with the calculated 
	0.1" depth of cut. That is probably due to not carefully finding zero on the corner. 
	The first finished octagonal face is shown in the second photo. The last photo shows 
	the completed pivot block. A little sanding cleaned up the uncut faces.
</p>

<p>
	The rest of the raw materials arrived and were opened this morning. The block of 
	aluminum is 3&nbsp;5/8" long. My call was in time! Still not sure whether to use 
	nylon or bronze for the bushings. I am leaning nylon. There won't be that much wear 
	on these bushings. The large 1018 steel bar is for the yoke. The ram will be made 
	from the turned, ground and polished 1045 steel rod. Not sure when I will get to 
	turning the aluminum block into the base in the cold garage.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA raw materials.jpg" alt="The rest of the materials for the slotter" width="2360" height="1612">


<p>
	The cut ends of the aluminum block are remarkably square as judged by the machinist's 
	square. They have saw marks, but they should easy to clean up in the lathe. Or the 
	shaper if it were working correctly. The yoke will be tackled next. Much of the work 
	can be done in the basement, though it is not clear how best to make the large 
	opening between the legs. The 0.5" radius cutout can be step drilled on the South 
	Bend lathe. Chain drilling should serve well for removing most of the material in the 
	slot. Before any of this is done the holes for the shoulder bolts need to be drilled. 
</p>

<p>
	The bar of steel purchased is 0.75"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2&nbsp;3/16" not the 2" width ordered. 
	I guess that is why they fudged with &plusmn;1/4". A 3" length of the bar was cut 
	off with the bandsaw. The part was held on the angle plate with two machinist's 
	clamps. After squaring the part relative to the table, the top face was cut square 
	with the other sides. The part was flipped over, set on the table and again clamped 
	to the angle plate. The opposite end was squared up with the two insert end mill.
</p>

<p>
	The block is 2.233" wide. The shoulder screws are 2&nbsp;1/16" long. The threads are 
	3/8" long and the head is 3/16" long. Shoulder length is 1.50". The arms will be 
	0.616" wide. A countersink of 0.358" leaves 0.375" for threads on the opposite arm. 
	It should be made a few thousandths less for safety. The block was marked out for the 
	three holes. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA yoke marked.jpg" alt="The yoke marked out for drilling" width="1762" height="1313">

<p>
	The two on the side were tackled first. The punch mark at 0.25" was aligned with the 
	spindle using the spud. The starting drill was used followed by a #25 drill. It was 
	drilled in increments of 0.15" using a lot of cutting fluid. There was no trouble 
	with the drill clogging even when it was 2" deep. The hole was drilled through. It 
	was then widened with a B drill to a depth of 1.858". Then this depth was reamed 
	0.250". The top of the hole was opened with an O drill followed by a 0.375" drill to 
	a depth of 0.25". A 0.375" end mill was used to produce a flat-bottomed hole 0.350" 
	deep. This sequence of events was repeated a further 1.25" from the first hole. Again 
	a lot of cutting fluid was used throughout the process. The last 3/8" of hole was 
	tapped 10-24 from the side opposite the drilling as the tap was not long enough to 
	follow the drill. After cleaning out the chips a shoulder bolt fit nicely in the 
	two holes.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA yoke pivot holes.jpg" alt="The yoke drilled for the two pivot holes" width="1151" height="1233">

<p>
	The best way I have come up with to cut the round ended slot in the yoke starts with 
	drilling. The picture below is a rough sketch of the drilling needed to rough out the 
	semicircle. If an "A" or a "B" drill is used there should be sufficient webbing between 
	holes so the drill does not wander. Final clean up would take place on the rotary 
	table. Before starting that the hole for the handle was drilled up to "O" and tapped 
	3/8-24. The handle fits well, but the threads on the handle are a little long.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA yoke hole pattern.png" alt="The hole pattern for cleaning out the yoke's slot'" width="1206" height="1246">

<p>
	Due to the oversize part the edges of the slot are 0.616" from the edge of the 
	part. Consequently, the four holes below the semicircle center line are centered at 
	0.741", 0.991", 1.241", and 1.491". These same holes are aligned 1.75" - 0.125" = 
	1.625" from the open end. (My part is not 3.5" long, only 3.0".) The second line of 
	holes are aligned at 1.625" + 0.226" = 1.851". Their centers from the edge are 0.866", 
	1.116", and 1.366". The third line of two holes are aligned at 2.077" and the two 
	hole centers are 0.991" and 1.241" from the edge. The photo below shows the marked 
	out hole centers plus the center of the 1" diameter arc.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA yoke holes marked.jpg" alt="The yoke marked for the clean out holes" width="2376" height="1654">

<p>
	The yoke was held on a block of wood with two strap clamps. A center drill was 
	aligned over the first of the holes in the four hole row. It was center drilled, 
	and then drilled with the "A" drill. (The "B" drill was dull.) Oil was applied 
	liberally when chips were cleared. All nine holes were drilled in this way as shown 
	in the photo.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA yoke holes drilling.jpg" alt="The yoke holes being drilled" width="2026" height="1548">

<p>
	The yoke with the drilled holes was held in the vise. The hacksaw was used to cut 
	down both sides of the opening to the holes. It was quite the right arm workout. The 
	scrap piece was knocked out with a hammer producing the roughed out yoke. The final 
	shot shows the yoke ready to be milled along with the center scrap.

<p>
	It is supposed to be unseasonably warm today. It is 45&deg; now and going up to 55&deg; 
	this afternoon. The body will be tackled. The ends need to be cleaned up and squared. 
	The main hole needs to be drilled and bored for the bearings. I might also do some 
	milling on the yoke using the milling attachment on the South Bend lathe.
</p>

<p>
	The block of aluminum purchased is 2.5"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3.6", while the 
	plans are for a block that is 2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2.75"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3.5". The 3" versus 
	2.75" is not a problem. I can either face it off or leave it be. the dimensions for 
	all of the features relying on this dimension are not impacted if they are all marked 
	out from opposite faces. The challenge is the 2" versus 2.5" dimension. I might try 
	removing the bulk of this with the bandsaw. Leaving it at 2.5" would just entail 
	extra material hanging off the right side when mounted. The band saw is needed to 
	cut off the waste at the top to leave the two protruding tabs. 
</p>

<p>
	The block was marked at 2" and cut off with the band saw. The cut was not very 
	straight, but luckily it was left oversized on one side, about 1/8". The block 
	was held against the angle block with a bar clamp. The top was milled with the 
	two flute cutter until it was flat and down to the 2" line. A 0.003" cut was made 
	to leave a nice finish.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA block milling.jpg" alt="Milling the first face of the block flat" width="2193" height="1959">
<img class=inline src="images/MSA block face milled.jpg" alt="The yoke roughed out" width="1554" height="1359">

<p>
	The block was turned and one of the cut ends was similarly milled till flat and 
	finished nicely. The block was flipped end for end and the opposite cut end was 
	also milled flat.
</p>

<p>
	After a bit of milling, 5/16" end mill at 0.031" depth and 0.150" wide cut, I decided 
	to remove the bulk of the material with a hack saw. The top was marked out to denote 
	the two 0.5"&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.5"&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.5" tabs. A saw cut was made parallel to 
	the two tabs down to almost 0.5". Starting from the opposite side of the tabs the top 
	was sawn down to the previous saw kerf. This took one full hour of hard hack sawing! 
	The block was set up in the mill with two clamps holding it against the angle plate. 
	The pretty crooked saw cut was cleaned up with many passes of the 5/16" end mill. The 
	second photo shows the clean up in progress. This left one side 1/2" high and 1/2" 
	wide for the two tabs.
</p>

<p>
	The next step was freeing the tabs. The raised part beyond the middle tab was removed 
	first. It was cut in 0.050"&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.150" increments with the 5/16" end mill. 
	The milling went surprisingly well considering how much material was being removed 
	and the distance from the vise to the cutting point. The area removed was milled to 
	match the depth of the top surface. The face of the tab was climb milled 0.005" for 
	clean up.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA tab freed.jpg" alt="The raised portion past the middle tab being removed" width="1590" height="1706">

<p>
	The material between the tabs was removed similarly. The first cut was at full end 
	mill width and was only 0.025" deep on each pass. The first photo below shows the 
	cutting in progress and the second is finished.
</p>

<p>
	The pivot is a nice fit between the tabs.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA pivot fit.jpg" alt="The pivot sitting between the tabs" width="1591" height="1415">

<p>
	The block of aluminum was again set up on the milling table clamped to the angle 
	plate. The end tab had been marked on center for the hole. A #25 drill was used to 
	drill through both tabs. This was followed by the "A" drill to a depth of 0.30" in 
	the second tab. A 0.250" reamer was used to make a perfectly round hole. Finally, a 
	3/8" end mill was used to make the counterbore 0.30" deep. The shoulder bolt fit 
	smoothly, but not when the pivot was inserted between the tabs. The hole was not far 
	enough from the top face of the block. The area between the two tabs was milled 
	0.050" deeper. The pivot now fits with room to spare when rotated.

<p>
	The body still has a number of features that need to be made. There is a hole for 
	mounting and a matching hole for a set screw. The main hole needs to be drilled 
	through and the ends need to be bored for the bearings. The bearings then need to 
	be bored in place. The yoke needs to have the opening widened to 1". The yoke also 
	needs to have the semi-circular opening milled on the rotary table.
</p>

<p>
	Tackled the body drilling and initial boring this morning in the unusually warm for 
	February, 40&deg; garage. The body was set up in the four jaw chuck so the marked 
	hole was aligned with the tailstock center. The hole was drilled up to 3/4". The 
	back gear was used for the 3/4" drill. The boring bar was installed on the toolpost 
	and the first 1" of the hole was bored to 1". Again the back gear was used. (It is 
	not very secure and pops out of gear if not careful!) Autofeed was also used. The 
	part was then turned around and the other end of the drilled hole was bored to 1" 
	for a depth of 1". The third picture below shows the completed boring for the bearing 
	next to the tea needed for warming the borer. The center 1" that is 3/4" diameter 
	also needs to be bored out to slightly larger than 3/4", so it does not interfere 
	with the movement of the 3/4" ram.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA body bored.jpg" alt="The body boring completed" width="1588" height="1373">

<p>
	The 1.5" of 3/4" central hole was bored open by 1/32" to allow free passage of the 
	ram. The wider bored ends were measured. Both were 0.83" deep. One was 1.001" in 
	diameter and the other was 0.984" in diameter. A 0.83" length of the purchased nylon 
	rod was cut off and hammered into the larger bore with the plastic hammer head. A 
	length of nylon was cut off and reduced to 0.986" diameter. It was cut off at 0.83". 
	It was drilled with a #19 drill just to allow for air release. It was hammered into 
	the smaller bore. The body with nylon bearings was centered in the four jaw chuck 
	on the South Bend lathe using a tailstock center. An attempt was made to drill out 
	the two bearings with a 5/32" drill. It got stuck and pulled the first bearing out 
	of the bore! The bearings will be glued in when the new two part epoxy arrives.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA bearing pulled.jpg" alt="The plastic bearing pulled out of the body while drilling" width="1606" height="2137">

<p>
	While waiting on the epoxy attention was returned to the yoke. The yoke was held on 
	a block of wood on the mill table as seen below. Each side was cut in small 
	increments. One side needed about 1/16" removed and this was done by aligning the 
	end mill with the scribed line and cutting down in 0.025" passes. The other side 
	required less material removed and the end mill was lowered in 0.050" increments. The 
	1/4" four flute end mill was used at 700 rpm. The pivot is a nice fit in this slot.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA yoke sides.jpg" alt="The sides of the yoke's slot milled" width="1768" height="1975">

<p>
	Performing the same cutting on the rounded end of the slot was tackled next. The 
	yoke was set up on spacers on the rotary table. The table was centered under the 
	spindle. An attempt was made to align the imaginary center of the yoke's semi-circle. 
	The table was moved in the y-direction in 0.050" steps. The end mill was lowered 
	0.050" and the table was rotated through 180&deg;. After lowering the end mill 15 
	times the table was again moved another 0.050". After a few passes it became clear 
	that the yoke was not centered under the spindle. This will need to be fixed before 
	cutting any further.
</p>

<p>
	A path forward was devised last night. A plastic cutoff that is 1" in diameter has 
	a small hole in the center. A square of carpet tape was affixed to one side and cut to 
	the diameter of the plastic. This was carefully attached to the yoke aligning the 
	plastic cylinder with the scribed semi-circle on the yoke. After re-centering the 
	rotary table the center of the plastic was aligned with the stub. It was clamped 
	down tight with two strap clamps. The picture shows the process though the aligning 
	hole in the plastic is not visible.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA yoke centering.jpg" alt="Centering the yoke on the rotary table" width="1823" height="2108">

<p>
	The remaining material was removed in cuts of 0.050"&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.050". It was 
	necessary to guess how deep to go as the scribed semi-circle was no longer visible. 
	The last few cuts were 0.010" deep and used the full length of the end mill to remove 
	the material in one pass. I may have gone a few thousandths too far. The cut looks 
	really good though. The surface finish is excellent. A minimal amount of deburring 
	and sanding and the Yoke de Triomphe was finished.
</p>

<p>
	The ram was next on the list. It was fairly straightforward, though a little large. 
	The bar of 3/4" ground and polished rod was cut to 8.5". It was held in the small 
	lathe with a three jaw chuck and the steady rest. The end was checked for 
	concentricity. The end was faced and a large 45&deg; chamfer was put on the end with 
	a file. The stock was flipped end for end in the lathe and faced. A 1" deep hole 
	was drilled with successively larger drills up to 31/64". The hole was reamed to 1/2". 
	The last drilling and the reaming had to be moved to the South Bend lathe in the 
	frigid garage.
</p>

<p>
	The part was held on a vee block with two strap clamps. The end with 1/2" hole was 
	located as was the center of the stock 0.500" from the end. A hole was drilled and 
	tapped 10-32. It was cleaned up and a set screw was installed. (The plans called for 
	a 1/4-28 set screw, but I don't have any.) The opposite end was drilled and reamed 
	1/4" through, 0.500" from the end. This completed the ram, shown in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA ram.jpg" alt="The completed ram with set screw and through hole" width="1831" height="1538">

<p>
	Well that was ridiculous! An attempt was made to construct the tool holder. A 2.5" 
	length of the ground and polished steel was cut off with a hacksaw. This was held in 
	the chuck and faced. A portentous chatter was experienced even when removing only 
	0.005". I was barely able to fit the steady rest between the carriage and the closest 
	approach of the cross slide in order to make the 0.93" long reduction in diameter. 
	Even with the steady there was tremendous chatter even during a 0.005" cut. The 
	cutting was switched from the tangential tool to the HSS insert tool. This was no 
	better. This part will have to be made using the South Bend lathe in the garage, 
	when the weather warms next week. In the meantime a photo documenting progress to 
	date.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA first assembly.jpg" alt="The assembled pivot through ram and handle" width="2145" height="1452">

<p>
	Moved the work out to the South Bend in the garage at 40&deg;. It was quick work. The 
	end was refaced and the diameter was reduced to just a bit more than 0.500" for 0.93". 
	It was a tight fit that was corrected by sanding. This resulted in a sliding fit with 
	a vacuum releasing 'pop' when the tool holder is pulled from the ram. The chamfer on 
	the other end was increased to the plan size.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA tool holder sized.jpg" alt="The tool holder cut to size" width="1208" height="1128">

<p>
	In order to drill the cutting tool hole at 10&deg; an angled support needed to be 
	made. The angle plate was set at 10&deg; and measured to make sure it was correct. 
	The vise was attached and a bar of aluminum scrap was held in the vise after 
	squaring the ends. It was milled in 0.010" increments as there was a lot of chatter 
	with deeper cuts. The vise was returned to the mill table and the tool holder was 
	mounted on the new angle plate and securely held. A flat was milled onto the end of 
	the tool holder. A mark was made at 0.218" for drilling. A center drill was used 
	first followed by four drills to get to 5/16". A lot of cutting fluid was utilized. 
	The photos show the angle plate and the drilled hole.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA tool holder drilled.jpg" alt="The tool holder drilled at ten degrees for the tool" width="1696" height="1394">

<p>
	The recommended way to ensure the crosshole for the set screw is perpendicular to 
	the angled tool hole is to drive a 1/4" square tool bit through the hole and use this 
	to suspend the tool holder for drilling. Easier said than done. The hole was first 
	marked and then four corners were filed in the 5/16" hole. This was fairly simple. 
	The tool bit was then hammered through on the tail of the vise in the garage. It was 
	not easy to drive the bit through and ensure it was aligned with the hole. In any 
	event it was eventually driven through as shown in the photo below. The damage to the 
	bit can be seen.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA bit through.jpg" alt="A tool bit driven through the holder" width="1257" height="1553">

<p>
	Per the article the tool holder was suspended on 7/8" parallels in the drill press 
	vise and set on the small drill press. The center was aligned under the spindle and 
	the vise clamped to the table. The holder was center drilled and then drilled with a 
	#25 drill prior to tapping 10-24 to match the largest set screw in my stock. The tool 
	was knocked out with a hammer. Not the best way to slide a tool in and out of the 
	holder. I will need to do some filing to make tool installation easier.
</p>

<p>
	I will work on the bearings this afternoon. In the meantime the 0.5" support hole and 
	the keyway need to be added to the body. Both are on the narrow face opposite the ram 
	hole. The hole is centered on the 2" dimension and 1.5" from the bottom. The slot is 
	0.38" from the center of the hole. The 3/16" slot extends from the top to 0.22" from 
	the bottom. The slot is 0.094" deep and the hole is 1.125" deep. The hole needs to be 
	finished flat-bottomed. These features were marked as well as the hole for the set 
	screw 1.5" up and 3/4" in from the hole and slot side.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA body holes marked.jpg" alt="The body marked for the slot and two holes" width="1895" height="1603">

<p>
	The body was held against the angle plate with a bar clamp. The spindle was aligned 
	with the mark and the hole was center drilled and drilled up to 7/16". It was moved 
	to the vise on the drill press. The hole was then drilled up to 1/2" to a depth of 
	1.125" (based on the tip of the drill). Again in the drill press a 1/2" end mill was 
	installed in the chuck. The bottom of the hole was milled flat. The hole measured 
	1.130" deep. This took all of the morning as many different attempts for drilling 
	and milling were tried and discarded.
</p>

<p>
	The body was clamped again to the angle plate in preparation for slot milling. Using 
	the spud the scribed line for the slot was aligned with the spindle. The table was 
	moved 0.094" and clamped on the y-axis. A 3/16" end mill was used to cut the slot in 
	increments of 0.010". After milling 0.094" deep the key from the lathe was inserted. 
	The fit was too tight so the slot was widened about 0.003". The height of the key 
	remaining above the body was measured at 0.130". The key is not square. The slot was 
	made 0.030" deeper for the key to fit about halfway. The photo shows the deburred 
	slot adjacent to the 0.5" hole.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA slot and hole.jpg" alt="The slot and hole in the body" width="1563" height="2080">

<p>
	Drilling the set screw hole was straightforward, but &hellip; The spindle was aligned, 
	the hole was started and drilled with an "F" drill. The hole was tapped 5/16-18 as 
	that is the match for the Sherline set screw. The fit was tried out after removing 
	the headstock. It was very 
	loose and no amount of fiddling made it any tighter. I realized at this point that 
	the hole needs to be 23/32" from the back of the body not 3/4". So the opposite side 
	was marked out and the same procedure as above followed. Still did not fit, but this 
	time fiddling around gave a tight fit. The key is that the key cannot go all the way 
	into the slot(?). The photo shows the proper setup to get a tight fit.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA body attached.jpg" alt="The body attached tightly to the Sherline mill" width="1733" height="2183">

<p>
	The nylon bearing that had been pulled out of the body during drilling was drilled 
	up to 31/64 on the Sherline lathe. A little oil helped control the tendency of the 
	drill to pull the bearing out of the chuck. A plug was made for the unused set screw 
	hole. A 3/8" aluminum rod was reduced to 5/16" for 1/2". After threading 5/16-18 it 
	was screwed into the hole with a few drops of Loctite. The stub was sanded off after 
	the glue dried.
</p>

<p>
	It was 42&deg; in the garage this morening so it was time to finish drilling and do 
	some boring. The block was held in the four-jaw chuck and the previously drilled 
	hole was used to center the bearings. This hole was drilled to 1/2" from its 31/64" 
	just to make sure all was in order. The undrilled bearing on the back side could not 
	be drilled without pushing it out of the body. The part was turned around in the 
	chuck after marking the center of the opposite bearing. It was close enough to center 
	for the boring operation to take care of any misalignment. It was center drilled and 
	drilled up to 1/2". The drilling went very well with no incidents of bearing pullout! 
</p>

<p>
	The boring bar was installed so that it would pass all the way through the 3" body 
	and bore both bearings simultaneously. The body was returned to the first, centered 
	position in the chuck. Boring was done in 0.015" increments. These went very well. 
	It was necessary to stop about 2/3 of the way through and remove the stringy chips 
	filling up the space between the bearings. The bore was measured as it got close to 
	size. Once it was within a few thousandths, the ram was used to test the fit. After 
	getting a tight fit an additional 0.001" was removed and this gave a perfect sliding 
	fit.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/MSA bearing boring.jpg" alt="The body set up in the lathe for boring" width="1927" height="1793">


<p>
	The body was removed from the chuck. The back bearing had a huge burr that ran all 
	the way around the hole. This was removed and the front bearing was also deburred. 
	The body, pivot, yoke, handle, and ram were assembled for testing. The movement is 
	smooth. The assembled slotting attachment is shown below.

	Below are three shots of the lightly sanded, assembled, and installed slotting 
	attachment. I can't wait to make a tool and try it out.

<p>
	Per the business card project a tool was ground for the internal gear. It was forced 
	into the ram and the slotter was installed on the Sherline mill. There is some play 
	in the ram movement and that gave a less than ideal cut. The attachment was removed 
	and taken apart. The bottom bearing (back bearing when bored) is oversized at 0.760". 
	I decided the simplest repair was to glue a piece of nylon into the bearing and 
	rebore.
</p>

<p>
	The body of the slotting attachment was returned to the South Bend lathe. Luckily 
	the chuck was still set up from the previous boring job. The back bearing (or bottom) 
	was bored out an additional 0.025" at which point the space between the two bearings 
	was just being scraped by the boring bar. The bearing opening measured 0.784". A scrap 
	of the nylon was faced and reduced to 0.782" in the Sherline. The part was drilled 
	up to 31/64 fairly easily only producing some hot drills. It was parted off at 3/4". 
	After deburring two-part epoxy was used to glue the insert in place.
</p>

<p>
	This morning the budgied bearing was bored to fit the ram. The top bearing, as done 
	previously, was dialed in with the dial indicator held in the tailstock chuck. The 
	bottom bearing was bored until the ram just fit. After removing the body from the 
	chuck and reassembling the slotter, there was no observable play in the ram.
