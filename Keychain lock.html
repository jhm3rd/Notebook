<p class=first>
	The keychain lock construction is based on a video by 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGOmtcz_oQo">Joe Pi</a>. It looks like a 
	padlock, but is opened by unscrewing a nut. Not the best security. I plan to decorate 
	it and give it to Rhea for Valentine's day.  
</p>

<p>
	A 1" length of 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" brass was cut from scrap stock. The two cut ends 
	were squared up on the mill using the vise and the cylindrical parallel. One end 
	was drilled with a 5/32" drill. The first hole was centered across the 1/4" width 
	and located 3/16" from one end. The second hole was 5/8" from the first. The first 
	was drilled 3/16" deep and the second was drilled 7/8" deep. Both holes were 
	chamfered. The side with the deeper hole was marked for later milling.
</p>

<p>
	The second part of this lock was a nut. A 1" length of 1/2" aluminum rod was held in 
	the three jaw chuck. It was faced and then knurled for about 3/8". The faced end was 
	chamfered. A hole was drilled about 3/4" deep with a #38 drill and tapped 5-44. The 
	nut was parted off at the end of the knurl. The parted end was also chamfered. The 
	photo below shows both parts at this stage.
</p>

<p>
	The pocket was cut with a 5/16" end mill. First the pocket was cut down the middle 
	and then the end mill was moved 3/32" to one side and the pocket was widened by 
	again cutting down. This was repeated 3/32" to the other side. The nut fit nicely 
	in the pocket.

<p>
	A 4" length of 1/8" drill rod was cut. One end was threaded 5-44 in the lathe with 
	a die. A bending die was modified to fit this project. A 5/8" diameter die was made 
	from scrap as well as a cylinder with a slight undercut (1/32") to trap the rod. The 
	rod was bent. The length of the free end was estimated and cut off. This end was 
	cleaned up. The lock parts are seen in the first photo below next to the bending jig. 
	The assembled lock is shown in the second photo. I am not happy with the bent rod 
	and will make a second and improved copy.
</p>

<p>
	Modified the bending jig slightly to improve the second attempt. This seems to be a 
	trial and error process. A second 4" of 1/8" drill rod was cut off and one end faced 
	and threaded for 7/8". The rod was bent in a semicircle. In order to bend the full 
	180&deg; vise grips were used as a stop. The bent rod needed a multiple adjustments 
	after the initial bending to look decent. The photo below shows the final result.
</p>

	The body of the lock was first sanded to round the edges on the belt sander. The 
	body was next sanded by hand with 180, 320, 600, 1000, & 2000 grit paper. This left 
	a nice matte finish. After washing with isopropanol and drying the first coat of 
	varnish was applied. A second coat was applied about 40 minutes later. The knurl was 
	cleaned up with a brush tool in the Dremel. It does not look much better. A second 
	knurl with a freely turning lower wheel did not look any better either. The steel 
	rod was polished. The lock at this stage is shown below.

<p>
	"Love" was engraved on one side and a heart on the other. This was done after using 
	acetone to remove the varnish. The china white did not work on varnish. The lock 
	body was cleaned with isopropanol. It was revarnished. I found a box that might be 
	suitable for wrapping the gift. I added some green felt to the inside and put a 
	coat of off white paint on the top to hide a logo. This was followed with a minimal 
	decoration in red. Realized that the "Love" and the heart were engraved upside down!
	Remade the part this morning, sanded it, engraved it, and varnished it, all by 1:30.
