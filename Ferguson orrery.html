	It is time to tackle another project, more complex than the recent projects: 
	Ferguson's Orrery. This project has been in my sights for years, but put off as 
	the previous orrery has still not been completed. The project entails some gearing 
	challenges, that I hope to overcome, by slightly modifying a later model of the 
	orrery. Most of the insights for this project come from 
	<a href="http://www.horo-logical.co.uk/orrery.html">Ian Coote's</a> excellent 
	discussion. I doubt I can capture his incredible reproduction, but hope to come close.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/FRG Coote repro.png" alt="Ian Cootes reproduction of the Ferguson Orrery" width="1744" height="756">

<p>
	The gearing challenge presented by the first iteration of Ferguson's orrery is that 
	three gears with slightly different numbers of teeth are all driven by one thick 
	gear having the same number of teeth. This demands that the three free gears don't 
	mesh well or that the teeth are specially cut by hand. A later model of the orrery 
	by Ferguson used a thick wheel that had slightly different sizes, top, middle, and 
	bottom, essentially three gears in one. My plan is to just make three gears and 
	lock them together with a pin as was done on my previous orrery.
</p>

<p>
	A brief digression is in order to discuss the purpose of this orrery as I interpret 
	it. Ferguson's orrery demonstrates the movement of the nodes and apogee of the moon's 
	orbit relative to the constellations in the night sky. The moon's orbit is tilted 
	relative to the plane of the ecliptic, or the plane of the earth's orbit around the sun 
	and the constellations residing in the ecliptic plane, the familiar sign's of the 
	zodiac. This tilted plane rotates around the earth, but always crosses the ecliptic
	 plane in two places, called nodes. The apogee is the position of the moon in its 
	orbit when it is farthest from the earth. The apogee circles the earth due to 
	precession in the moon's orbit and takes nine years, 8.85, to make a full loop. The 
	nodes precess around the earth with a period of eighteen and one half years, 18.61. 
	When one of these nodes aligns with a line from the sun to the earth, and the moon 
	resides at the aligned node, an eclipse is possible. Another pic from Coote's page 
	shows these features of the orrery.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/FRG moon orbit.png" alt="The Ferguson Orrery showing the details allowing it to demonstrate eclipses" width="2296" height="1606">

<p>
	The number of gear teeth are the same as used by Ferguson in his model as these do 
	a great job of accurately demonstrating the nodes of the moon's orbit and the moon's 
	apogee circling the earth. The table below outlines the parameters of these gears. 
	The top gear refers to the gear driving the moon's apogee indicator (bottom disk), 
	the middle gear refers to the gear driving the moon's orbit (middle disk), and the 
	bottom gear drives the ecliptic constellations ring (top disk). Of course the gears 
	are connected to their respective disks by concentric tubes.
</p>

	<caption>
		A diametral pitch of 30 was chosen for these gears as I have gear cutters for that pitch.
	</caption>
</table>

<p>
	Now for the challenge! The three driven gears and the their drivers all need to share 
	the same distance between centers, but their diameters vary. The theoretical center 
	to center distance of the bottom driven and driver gears, both 39 teeth, (the sum of 
	their pitch radii) is the same as their pitch diameters, 1.300". For the middle gears 
	this is 1.267" and for the top gears, 1.383", differences of 1/32" and 5/64" 
	respectively. In order to accomodate the larger center distance the smaller might not 
	even mesh. 
</p>

<p class = "note">
	All of the numbers in the table came from the "Spur Gear" calculator, while the numbers 
	below came from the "Gears" calculator, both accessible from the sidebar.
</p>

<p>
	To "fix" these differences the driver gears need to start with slightly different 
	pitch diameters resulting in a diametral pitch different from the 
	standard 30 used above. For instance a diametral pitch for the middle gears of 29 
	gives a center to center distance of 1.310", close enough. Similarly, a diametral 
	pitch of 31.5 for the top gears gives a center to center distance of 1.317". These 
	changes will require hand adjusting the tooth sizes of the 39/44 and 39/37 gears or 
	making my own gear cutters.
</p>

<p>
	This raises an interesting question. If more teeth are put on the wheel, than the 
	calculations predict by altering the angle between the teeth, can the teeth just be 
	made skinnier by cutting a fraction deeper? Similarly, could fewer teeth be put on 
	a wheel, but cutting not so deeply? The former is less of a problem as the smaller 
	teeth will be loose, but not bind. The latter may lead to binding. 
</p>

<p>
	I am having second thoughts about making this orrery. The most interesting aspect of 
	this particular orrery was Ferguson's paradox, which I have not discussed. I am not 
	that interested in his paradox, but in demonstrating the moon, its orbit, and 
	potential eclipses. I would like this orrery to also show the moon's location as 
	it revolves around the earth. Consequently, the gear train is being reconsidered.
	The entire gear discussion above is probably wrong. The sun gear is driving the next 
	two gears, the middle gear is then an idler gear and the number of its teeth is 
	irrelevant to the resulting gear ratio. The above discussion only makes sense if the 
	sun gear tooth number is modified. The idler gears can be any number of teeth and 
	consequently any size necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Of more interest to me is the following table of things to track with this orrery 
	as well as various parameters that need to be emulated. One further complication of 
	this orrery as currently arranged is that it depicts a sidereal year, the year as 
	seen from the stars. The moon makes 13.368 orbits in a sidereal year as it has also 
	made one loop around the sun. Similarly, Ferguson's orrery and its gear train shows 
	the sidereal orbits of the nodes and apogee, 1.054 and 1.113.

<p>
	To further the design of this lunar orrery, distances between gear's centers need to 
	be determined. The gear pairs for the Earth, nodes, and apogee will be separated by 
	an idler gear, so their distances are flexible. Ferguson's design had them separated 
	by approximately two diameters of a 39-tooth wheel or about 3" with my gear cutters. 
	The maximum size of the four gear train is the sum of the radii of the four gears. 
	This can be reduced to some extent by offsetting the central gear pair from the line 
	between the driver and the driven gear. In other words there is a lot of flexibility 
	to establishing the distance between the sun and the earth.
</p>

<p>
	After numerous computations with "Spur Gear" utility listed in the left sidebar, an 
	appropriate set of gears has been identified. The following table outlines the 
	results. The initial set of four gears for the moon's orbit produced too small of 
	a separation between centers to be useful for the other gear sets. Doubling the 
	last two gears gave an uncannily perfect fit as seen in the table below.

<p>
	Well so much for that idea! A sketch quickly revealed the problem, the centers of 
	the idler gears and the center of the four gear train are not aligned. Even the 
	centers of the idlers are not aligned. Orrery design is tough! 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/FRG gear sketch.heic" alt="A sketch of the proposed gears indicating the problem" width="3690" height="1710">

<p>
	There is a <a href="https://www.engineeringcommons.org/orrery-design">path forward</a> 
	with the above design. The gears need to be sufficiently separated to allow passage 
	of supports between them, almost a ladder of supports in this case can be used to 
	support the shafts of the central gears. Below is a better sketch of the proposed 
	gearing setup showing the shelves below the three idler gears.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/FRG gear sketch II.png" alt="A sketch of the proposed gears indicating the supports" width="1328" height="1208">

<p>
	The above sketch implies the idler gears are all on a line between the centers of 
	the two stacks. This will work, of course, but also leaves one very little flexibility 
	when depthing the gears, they all have to fit precisely. If the central gears are 
	set off of this line, the gear stack centers are brought closer together. If they 
	are a little too close for a central gear it can be moved further out. Alternatively, 
	if they are a little too far apart the center gear can be moved closer to the line. 
	This flexibility is important and needs to be baked into the plan. Spacers will also 
	be required between gears in the two gear stacks.
</p>

<p>
	The next design challenge is the configuration of the shelf supports for the center 
	gears, idlers. Two things need to be considered with this part of the design. First, 
	the means of attachment to vertical supports on one or both sides as these shelves 
	should be reasonably thin. Second, is that the supports need to be added with the 
	two gear stacks in place, so the depthing tool can set the correct location for 
	the idler gear's axle. From an esthetic perspective the vertical supports should not 
	be 	a solid rectangle of brass, but something decorative.
</p>

<p>
	It is time to purchase brass for this orrery. With the current gear plan, 13 gears, 
	and the four rotating bases a lot of brass is needed. These parts can be made from 
	round bar stock or from flat stock. Six parts can be made from 1.5" stock, three from 
	2" stock, two from 2.5" stock, five from 1" stock and one from 1/2" stock. In addition 
	the top and bottom bars spanning the gear stacks require 2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;12" bar 
	stock. The side rails will need about 5" of 1" stock. All of the above can be either 
	3/16" or 1/4" thick. The support shelves will need 1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;6". 
	The base is approximately a 7" circle. Tubing required is 5/16", 1/4", & 3/16". All 
	of the axles will use 1/8" round bar stock (on second thought the axle for the driver 
	gear stack maybe should be 1/4"). Assorted screws and spacers complete the 
	parts list.
</p>

<p class="note">
	With 1/4" thick gears and spacers the total height of the the gears between the top 
	and bottom bars is 2". Switching to 3/16" thickness material for the gears and 
	spacers drops this to 1.5", which sounds like a better match for this small orrery.

<p>
	After a few weeks to recover from the starvation brought on by taking Rybelsus, it is 
	time to return to this orrery. The first item on the agenda is a detailed set of 
	drawings to keep me on the straight and narrow. I plan to utilize FreeCAD, since the 
	Fusion 360 used in the past is no longer supported on my eight year old MacBook Pro. 
	FreeCAD still supports Macs with Intel silicon.
</p>

<p>
	After spending time with FreeCAD I am not convinced that the time invested will 
	return the investment for this project. The only important variable is the location 
	of the centers of the idler wheels. A simpler spreadsheet can probably provide this 
	information. Alternatively a quick program in JavaScript could provide a list of 
	possible locations.
</p>

<p>
	Some careful work in JohnDraw indicates that a 2" separation between the the two 
	gear stacks allows room to locate the idlers and the reduction gear pair. The photo 
	below shows the sketch leading to this conclusion. The drawing also provides the 
	stack height, 2&nbsp;3/4" using 1/4" thick gears, 3/16" gears reduces the dimension 
	shown in the drawing by 5/16" to 2&nbsp;7/16".
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/FRG gear sketch III.heic" alt="A sketch of the proposed gears and possible idler layout" width="4768" height="3961">

<p class="note">
	The reduction gears need a better way to determine location. The sketch above was 
	trial and error. Graphically, if the center of the 63 tooth gear is at (0,0) and the 
	center of the 18 tooth gear is at (2,0), then the center of the reduction gear stack 
	is at (1.125,0.5). This is the intersection of two circles: the first centered at 
	(0,0) with radius (2.1 + 0.367)/2 and the second centered at (2,0) with radius 
	(1.4 + 0.6)/2. A calculation tool of some sort is in order and, of course, <a href="https://planetcalc.com/8098/">one</a> 
	is available on the web. This calculator gives the coordinates as (1.131,0.494). Who
	needs a calculator!!!
</p>

<p>
	With the brass in hand it is time to get started on the thirteen gears. My plan is 
	to use a common holding system to cut the outer diameter on the lathe and the teeth 
	on the mill. This means that all gears will need the same size central hole, 1/4". 
	The gears attached to smaller tubes will be fitted with a bushing after cutting 
	their teeth.
</p>

<p>
	The pitch diameters were used for the above calculations, but the outer diameters 
	are needed for making the gears. The table below lists the outer diameters for the 
	thirteen gears. (30 diametral pitch gear cutters)

<p>
	It is Pearl Harbor Day, which happened about fifteen years before my birth. So long 
	ago that we have forgotten the lessons learned from countries with populist leaders. 
	Five 1&nbsp;1/2" long gear blanks were cut from the 1&nbsp;1/2" flat brass stock with 
	a hack saw. Each square was marked with diagonals and drilled and reamed 1/4" on 
	center. The blanks were mounted on a mandrel and turned to 1.367". The chuck holding 
	the mandrel was moved to the Sherline gear cutting attachment mounted on the mill.
</p>

<p>
	Of course a problem was discovered, luckily before cutting teeth, the gear cutter 
	mandrel needed major repairs as the gear cutter did not run true. This mandrel was 
	moved to the lathe held in the milling collet. It was faced cleaning up the two 
	surfaces holding the cutter. The biggest issue was the 1/4" square steel key. It was 
	not on center! A new key slot was milled 0.28" deep on center. The new mandrel with 
	gear cutter inserted runs reasonably true now and is ready to cut the 460 teeth for 
	this project. The mandrel with the three gear blanks was returned to the Sherline 
	gear cutting attachment. Teeth (or gaps) were cut to depth in six passes. The two 
	photos below show the reduction of squares to circles and cutting the gears. Burrs 
	were removed in the lathe with a file, producing the three 39 tooth gears seen in 
	the fourth photo.

	wide. The corners were removed before turning with the collet in the lathe to 1.300" 
	diameter. The teeth were cut in two tranches as it is a little mind numbing. The gear 
	was deburred with a file and is shown below. The perfect mesh with a 39 tooth gear 
	in the <a href="Depthing Tool.html">depthing tool</a> is also seen below.

	The 42 tooth gear was then cut. Its manufacture was straightforward, if tedious. The 
	blanks were hacksawed from stock for the remaining eight gears as seen in the photo 
	below. As shown the centers were marked, then punched and all drilled and reamed to 
	1/4".

	The eighteen tooth gear blank was reduced to 0.667" diameter. At this point it was 
	realized that the 1/4" washers used for spacing from the nut were almost at the same 
	diameter, so these were reduced to 0.144" less diameter than the blank. The part was 
	transfered to the mill for cutting the teeth. The second limitation of this setup 
	with this blank was revealed. The gear is too close to the steel backing of the 
	mandrel. The mandrel was cut into slightly to insure the teeth were cut all the 
	way through. The final cut revealed the third problem the first tooth was cut too 
	thin resulting in the last tooth being cut too thick! This is seen below along with 
	the cuts into the mandrel. Arrgh! At least it was a quick gear to cut! The process 
	was repeated for this gear after cutting a 0.75" square of 3/16" brass. The second 
	photo below shows the completed 18 tooth gear.

	The nineteen tooth gear was completed this morning. One tooth was a little fat but 
	was indistinguishable from the rest after a bit of filing. Maybe that was due to the 
	Friday the 13th gremlin. The forty-seven tooth gear was prepped next. Since the center 
	hole was already cut the approximate radius was marked in the corners so they could 
	be removed before cutting the blank to 1.633" diameter. The first dozen teeth were 
	cut before stopping for lunch and to let the back and shoulders relax. The forty-seven 
	teeth were finished the following morning. It and the nineteen tooth gear are seen 
	below.

	Swapping time with the Dovetail Puzzle Boxes and found some time for another gear, 
	the 63 tooth gear, figuring I might as well get the most difficult out of the way. 
	(Difficult only in so far as managing the tedium of cutting that many teeth.) The 
	corners were removed from the square blank and the octagon was turned to a circle of 
	2.167" diameter. About one third of the teeth were cut when I noticed a problem. 
	The gear cutting blade was not on center!! I had entered a wrong number in the 
	calculator. The resulting teeth are not pointing directly out from center but are 
	all canted as seen in the photo below. These teeth demand the services of a 
	qualified orthodontist.

<p>
	The forty-nine tooth blank was available, so it was cut into an octagon and reduced 
	to a circle with a diameter of 1.700". This was set up in the gear cutting accessory 
	on the milling table with the gear cutting blade on center. All teeth were cut in one 
	sitting, quite the arbeit. The photo below shows the forty-nine well-formed teeth.

<p>
	The blank for the 63 tooth gear was remade and reduced in diameter to 2.167" as 
	before. The teeth were cut over the course of a day as I can only cut many teeth when 
	the wife is out of the house as the intermittent cutting makes a lot of noise. Two 
	hours of cutting and the gear is complete as seen below. This leaves the 11, 28, and 
	29 tooth gears.
</p>

<p>
	The blank for the 29 tooth gear was reduced to 1.033" and the teeth were cut. The 
	same for the 28 tooth gear after reducing to 1.000".

<p>
	The final 11 tooth gear was made from a 1/2" brass round bar. A piece was cut off, 
	drilled and reamed to 0.125", reduced to 0.433" and then faced to 3/16" long. A 
	mandrel was made from 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" brass round bar. About 1/2" was reduced 
	to 0.125". The first 3/8" was further reduced to 0.112" and threaded 4-40. The 
	mandrel when held in the chuck with the gear blank in place was not long enough, 
	the gear tooth cutter would hit the chuck. An extension was made from 1/2" aluminum 
	round bar by facing, drilling, and reaming to 1/4". After a drop of Loctite was put 
	into the hole the brass mandrel was pushed in, allowing the air to escape. The photo 
	shows this setup ready for cutting teeth.

<p>
	The small mandrel was quickly discovered to have a problem, the tailstock in the 
	gear cutting attachment was too close and wide hindering access of the cutter to the 
	workpiece. The tailstock from the lathe was switched and with a drill chuck 
	installed along with a small center worked somewhat. The second issue was that there 
	was such a small hole in the end of the mandrel that the center provided minimal 
	support resulting in  a lot of chatter, which caused other things to come loose 
	during the cut. Even with these issues the cutting was forced to completion and the 
	460th tooth was cut (not counting the two failed gears). The photo below shows all of 
	the gears made with the latest on top. The second photo below shows the thirteen 
	gears laid out on the diagram from above with all gears mated with their partners.
