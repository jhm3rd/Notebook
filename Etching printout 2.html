<h2 class="noprint">Orrery Etching Printouts 2</h2>



<p class="noprint">
	This is just a fragment of the first version to modify the printouts for the text 
	following the curves around the planet rings. There are two rings, Earth & Mars with 
	two quotes each. These quotes need greater separation. The number of spaces was 
	modified until the two quotes seemed equally spaced, before and after. All four rings 
	have the red circle that anchors the text in an arc. These circles need to be changed 
	to black so they will not affect the etching. To do this the color of the path was 
	changed from #ff0000 to #000000. All other parts of the previous page have been 
	deleted. The screen view was captured, saved as a png (Rings with spaced quotes.png) 
	and included below. Ready to be printed on OHP acetate!
</p>


<p class="noprint">
	The SVG path begins by Moving the pen to M50,200. An Arc is then drawn. The first 
	two numbers (100, 100) are the radii in x and y directions. The last two numbers 
	(51,201) are the endpoint of the arc. The zero is a flag for x-axis rotation and is 
	seldom used. The first 1 is a flag for "large arc". When on, a large arc is drawn 
	to connect the two points, while off a smaller connecting arc is drawn. The last 
	flag sets the direction of the arc. 1 is clockwise. A test version was printed out 
	with black letters on a white background. The printed circles are 7% larger than 
	the screen sizes, so the SVG code was adjusted accordingly. The following SVG code 
	gives the correct sizes for Mercury, Venus and Earth. To easily cut out the circles 
	the SVG should include inside and outside circles for each planet or marked 
	centerpoints. Need longer quotes for Venus (30%) and Earth (50%) as well as adding 
	inside and outside circles. [<em>Note: this was all done with the Safari browser.</em>]
	The following SVG code was optimized in <a href="etch test.html">the testing page</a> 
	and pasted in place here. As seen above this does not print out what is seen on 
	the screen so a screen shot was taken, the SVG code was commented out, and the 
	screen shot was used in its place.

<p class="noprint">
	Ran the above script to get a picture on the screen. This was captured with Screen 
	Capture and saved as a png file. This png file was opened with Preview and saved 
	as a pdf file. The file was saved in iCloud and then mailed to OfficeDepot@printme.com.
	The pdf was printed on acetates provided by the attendant. The Mercury ring was 
	removed from the orrery and polished again to remove some tarnish that was starting 
	to appear. After washing with soap and water and degreasing with acetone it was held 
	above the appropriate printed ring, only to discover that the printed ring was too 
	big!!! I now need to go back through the process to determine where the size change 
	occurred. It looks like conversion from png to pdf changed the size from 2" to 
	2&nbsp;3/8". The next attempt was to open a pdf and drag the thumbnail from the 
	opened png file into the new pdf. Unfortunately, this also changed the size of the 
	ring (2" to 2&nbsp;1/8"). Now what?
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	A path forward is simple enough. Heard from an Apple discussion that Preview 
	automatically compresses image files and this is responsible for size changes. So 
	this is a no go, unless I switch to a high-end program like Adobe. Looking on the 
	PrintMe website indicated that png is an acceptable file format for their software 
	and printers. So it is back to Office Depot to print this yet again. Purchased 
	acetates (100 for $46!) at Staples.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	I have returned to the orrery in late June after four and one-half months. I realized 
	a major problem with the engraving on the top dodecagon of the frame. The months are 
	arranged in a clockwise order. Of course the planets revolve around the sun 
	counterclockwise!!! That and my dislike of the engraving itself implies it needs to 
	be redone. There was one more problem with the top frame: the finish. I do not like 
	the way the spray varnish looks. It looks "pebbly". So I will flip the frame top over 
	and etch the new top side. The drilling and engraving are too deep to attempt to sand 
	them off. Probably 1/32" of brass would need to be removed. I might need to open the 
	holes for the column screws to provide enough leeway to flip the dodecagon. 
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	I decided to use a program called Graphic. It allows dimensional control, but functions 
	more like a graphics program. I do not remember why it did not work for text around 
	circles forcing me to learn SVG. In any event this seemed like a simpler task for 
	which Graphic seemed suited. It is also very easy to use. The plan is to etch three 
	things into the dodecagon: the month abbreviations, the astronomical symbols, and the 
	tick marks (beginning and ending months and constellations). The dodecagon was easily 
	made to exact dimension. The diameters of dodecagons are 9&nbsp;3/16" and 
	7&nbsp;11/16". These two dodecagons were drawn and quickly aligned by eye. 
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	The months were a perceptual challenge. Since, the printout needs to be flipped, they 
	were arranged clockwise around the dodecagon sections. Actually flipping the text was 
	slightly confusing: do the months on the sides need to have their text flipped 
	backwards? Well it turns out they do. So each block of text created was first flipped 
	so it was a mirror image of the original. I proceeded around the dodecagon in a 
	clockwise direction with the months. "Jan" at the top was first. It was flipped, put 
	in place and then duplicated. The duplicate was dragged to the approximate new 
	position. The text was changed and the text was rotated 330&deg;. (The dihedral angle 
	of a dodecagon is 150&deg;.) This was continued around the dodecagon until all 12 
	months were flipped, rotated and in position. This file was saved as "Dodecagon for 
	etch.idraw". The font used is "Euphoria Script", size 16.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	Next up were the astronomical symbols. The Arial font has all of them except Ophiucus. 
	They were pasted into a TextEdit document, because it has a great font viewer. From 
	TextEdit each was pasted into a new text block. These blocks then went through the 
	same process as above, though some of the symbols are symmetrical and did not require 
	flipping. Each was carefully placed in relation to the month abbreviation so they 
	would turn out similar to the current placement. Since there is no symbol for Ophiucus, 
	I decided to use the mathematical union symbol. The Ophiucus symbol is a "U" with a 
	wavy line through the middle. I can just scratch the wavy line into the printed "U" 
	prior to transferring ink to brass. The file was saved at this point as "Dodecagon 
	for etch 2.idraw". The Arial font was used here (it is one of the few fonts with all 
	of the symbols) also in size 16.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	The file "Dodecagon for etch 2.idraw" was printed on two pages. First of all looking 
	at the printout in the mirror indicated that all of the flipping and rotation gave 
	the correct orientation and positioning of the different elements. Measurements were 
	taken and the sizes of the printed dodecagon were spot on. These files are still 
	black on white and will need to be turned into negatives prior to printing for 
	etching.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	Checking the <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/Solar">online orrery</a> for 
	consistency and it shows December at the top of the picture. Currently, I have 
	January at the top when the crank is on the right. This needs to be changed. This 
	movement should help relieve the Libra, Scorpius, Ophiucus crunch from November to 
	December. Currently there is a column screw right in the middle of Scorpius, which is 
	the shortest constellation period. Consequently, it is the most cramped constellation 
	and can't handle the screw in its midst. This shift will move that screw to the end 
	of October a definite improvement. The next screw moves from August to July. It may 
	impinge a little on Cancer, but there are few stars in Cancer. The next screw moves 
	from May to April and there is plenty of room for it there. The final screw moves 
	from February to January and again there is plenty of room.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	The month and constellation separators were added last. Two diamonds, filled and open, 
	were used for the separators. Again they were pasted in from TextEdit and rotated. No 
	flipping was needed as they are symmetric. These diamonds are again Arial font so they 
	should be readily available when printing. (Though the entire picture will probably be 
	converted to a PNG prior to printing.) The separators were placed pretty close to the 
	line and at appropriate locations as close as possible to where they were in the 
	engraved version. A picture of the final file, "Dodecagon for etch 3.idraw" is below. 
	Alongside it is the "negative" version for the etching print. (The actual file is 
	saved without the grid lines.)
</p>

</p>

<p class="noprint">
	The plan at this point is to print all of the PNG files on the home printer and double 
	check sizes. Then the same files will be printed on the laser printer at Office Depot. 
	These etching printouts will be transfered to the brass. The brass will be etched 
	after sanding and polishing. The constellations will then be drilled as done 
	previously. The month abbreviations, constellation symbols, and separators will be 
	highlighted with either blue or black fingernail polish. Finally, the surface will 
	be coated with some type of varnish. All of the steps from the etching on (except 
	drilling) will require a significant amount of experimentation on brass samples.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	I got some printing done at OfficeDepot finally. Not quite what I wanted, but that is 
	another story. I had a section of dodecagon polished but with a little tarnish. I saw
	recommendations on the web for a paste of salt and lemon juice for removing tarnish 
	from brass. After a lot of elbow grease expended I could see no evidence of tarnish 
	removal. So I sanded the scrap with 220 to 1500 grit. It was then polished on the 
	cotton wheel with red rouge. It had a nice shine so I decided it was ready for 
	transfer experiments.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	A fragment of one of the acetates was cut out and taped to the brass with masking 
	tape. The hot iron (as hot as it will go) was applied to the taped acetate for two 
	minutes. The tape was peeled off and the acetate removed. There was only partial 
	transfer. The tape glue was removed with mineral spirits and the transfered ink with 
	acetone for another trial. To make a long story short after eight attempts I found 
	that the ideal conditions were as follows: an even thickness of tape across all of 
	the part, taped in two directions to make sure the acetate was held tightly to the 
	brass, iron temperature set just below "cotton", three and one half minutes of 
	heating using the heel of the iron with the part sitting on a wooden block, the 
	iron was kept resting on the part with back and forth movements to ensure even 
	heating, and the part was removed from the wood block and set on the cast iron table 
	saw table for quicker cooling. Two pictures of the successful transfer are below.
</p>

	<img class=inline src="images/Ink transfer 2.jpg" alt="Brass etching ink transfer 2" width="1408" height="814">
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	As can be seen the "successful transfer" is not perfect. This could be due to a number 
	of factors. The ink on this acetate was not very thick. Others may be better as they 
	are printed by OfficeDepot on their commercial printers, not on the one for customer 
	use. It is possible the time could be extended to four minutes. One of the problems 
	seen early on was ink flow. If the brass was heated too long the text was cloudy and 
	could disappear entirely. It was difficult to find a time between three and four 
	minutes that produced good transfer without ink flow. That was the reason to drop to 
	a lower temperature. At this lower temperature I have not pushed the time long enough 
	to see evidence of ink flow.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	One final note. The length of heat application will need to be adjusted for the 
	thickness of the brass part. The time it takes to get the part hot enough to melt and 
	transfer the ink will most likely vary based on the thickness of the part. Doing a 
	large part may be quite the challenge. At least it is simple to clean the ink from 
	the part and try again.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	This morning etching was begun! The brass part above was prepared by covering some 
	areas with fingernail polish, mostly where the ink did not transfer sufficiently. It 
	was also taped with Scotch clear packing tape on the sides and the back. Using a 
	rolled bit of the tape it was attached to a block of styrofoam. A small tape 
	<em>handle</em> was attached to the back of the styrofoam block. The purchased 
	condiment tray was used to hold the etchant. In fact the etchant was poured into the 
	<em>dip</em> bowl in the center of the tray. Only about 1/4" was added. The brass 
	part was lowered into the ferric chloride solution. It was kept in the bath for 40 
	minutes. It was agitated every few minutes for one minute over the last half hour. 
	It was removed and the acid rinsed off with the garden hose. The tape was removed 
	and the ink was wiped off with acetone. Further rinsing with a solution of baking 
	soda was followed by water and drying with acetone. The result is below.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The etching needs to go longer than the 40 minutes done here. Alternatively, the acid 
	could be warmed up for a faster reaction. The taping needs to be more carefully done. 
	There are a few places along the edges where the acid got to the metal and did a nice 
	job etching. On the whole though, I am pleased with this first attempt.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	This morning I will make a second attempt to etch the brass. I plan on keeping the 
	iron on the brass for 4 minutes and etching longer with more consistent agitation. 
	The first shot at 4 minutes again led to flow, not as much as at the higher temperature, 
	but still quite noticeable. So a second attempt was made at three and one-half 
	minutes. It looked good except for some spots that got no transfer. I painted on the 
	fingernail polish an the sides and on the face where the black ink was a little hazy. 
	I also filled in some spots on either side of "is". These fixes can be seen in the 
	following photo.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	<img class=inline src="images/Inked for etching 2.jpg" alt="Brass etching test" width="1666" height="1499">
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	I am not sure how long to let the fingernail polish dry before applying the tape and 
	etching the brass. I will wait one hour to make sure. After one hour the brass was 
	taped with packing tape. It was taped to the styrofoam block and the block was given 
	a tape handle. A little more FeCl<sub>3</sub> solution was added to the bowl and the 
	brass was etched for one hour. It was agitated every five minutes for one minute. It 
	was then thoroughly rinsed outside and then neutralized with baking soda. The paint 
	and ink were removed with acetone. As can be seen in the picture below the etching 
	went very well. It is etched significantly deeper than the first attempt. The real 
	challenge is still the transfer. The transfer glitches are clearly visible even after 
	trying to touch up some of them with fingernail polish.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	<img class=inline src="images/Etching test 2.jpg" alt="Brass etching test" width="1539" height="696">
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	An attempt was made to improve the transfer. A printout from a different printer was 
	used and taped to a newly polished brass scrap. After 3&nbsp;1/2 minutes of heating 
	with the iron the part was cooled. The tape was removed and once again the transfer 
	was mostly ok, but there were multiple spots that did not transfer the ink. A small 
	scrap of 1/16" brass was also polished. A piece of transparency with text was taped 
	to one side. The brass was only heated for one minute and ten seconds. Removing the 
	tape showed significant flow in this short period. Maybe 45 seconds would be more 
	appropriate for this thinner brass.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	Looking on the internet there were a few recommendations for how best to transfer 
	ink to metal. One author indicated that two variables were the most important, 
	temperature and pressure. The second surprised me. This author had taken an old iron, 
	took it apart and attached the bottom face up on a support. He only heated the iron 
	to 135&deg; C. He used a rolling pin with his body weight to apply the pressure for 
	one to two minutes. Well I was not able to completely use his methodology. I lowered 
	the temperature of the iron to just under wool (wool is ~148&deg; C) and leaned hard 
	on the iron. Two minutes for the 3/16" and fifty seconds for the 1/16" brass. The 
	iron could not be moved during the application of pressure. The results are seen in 
	the following picture.
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	<img class=inline src="images/Ink transfer 3.jpg" alt="Brass ink transfer test" width="2431" height="2320">
</p>

<p class="noprint">
	The results were mixed. The letters are very well formed, but the transfer is rather 
	blobby. More ink was transfered in some places than others. There are still spots 
	that did not transfer, though fewer in the places where the ink transfered well, e.g. 
	the left side of the dodecagon part. It is likely the weight would work better if the 
	force could be spread evenly over the part like for instance with a rolling pin. How 
	easy would it be to build a support for the iron??
