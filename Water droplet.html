<p class=first>
	I have considered making a water droplet automaton for some time: ever since 
	viewing this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqzjAmPFND8">Water 
	Experiment 33</a>. It is about time for a cutter to be put to metal.
</p>

<p>
	The automaton will be made of wood and metal. All of the moving parts will be made 
	of brass or aluminum and the frame will be made of wood. After looking at the video 
	I decided on a scale for the project. Twenty-five wheels are used and will be made 
	of 3/16" thick aluminum. The wheels will span 25 X 3/16" = 4.688" and the largest 
	ring will then be 4.688" - 3/16" + 1/8" = 4 5/8" in diameter. All rings will be cut 
	from a 1/16" thick brass disk and will be 1/8" wide. (This leaves 1/16" between 
	rings.) A 1/16" end mill will cut the rings from the disk.
</p>

<p>
	The wheels (two each) will have the following diameters (in): 1.000, 1.083, 1.167, 
	1.250, 1.333, 1.417, 1.500, 1.583, 1.667, 1.750, 1.833, and 1.917. The center wheel 
	will be about 2" in diameter. The sides of the wheels will be made slightly concave 
	to fit the round ends of the shafts. The hole for the axle will be located about 1/4" 
	from the edge of each wheel and the axle will be glued in place. A handle for the 
	shaft will be similar to the handle for the orrery: 
	(<a href="Orrery Handle.html">Orrery Handle</a>). The width of the wheels is 3/16". 
	The wheels are all touching faces except the center wheel which has a wheel-width 
	gap between it and the wheels on either side. The total width of the wheels is 
	therefore: 24 * 3/16 + 3 * 3/16 = 5 1/16". 
</p>

<p>
	The base will be made of wood and will be 3/4" thick. (The model in the video has 
	two 3/4" thick boards joined face-to-face in the base.) Four columns will support both 
	the middle platform and the top platform. The two top platforms will only be 
	separated by about 1" and serve to keep the moving shafts vertical. Alternatively, 
	the two top platforms could be replaced by a 3/4" thick single platform, which would 
	be thick enough to keep the shafts aligned. These two platforms will be 1/4" thick 
	and have a line of 25 - 1/8" holes drilled through on 3/16" centers (except for the 
	center hole which will be 3/8" from the holes on either side of it). (Brass/bronze 
	inserts may be used as well.) The shafts will be made from 1/8" brass rod and will 
	be about 4.5" long. The rods will be rounded on one end and soldered/glued to the 
	rings on the other end. (Need to design a jig to ensure the rods are perpendicular 
	to the rings when soldering them in place.)
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Water frame.jpg" alt="Water droplet frame" width="1414" height="1312">

<p class=note>
	Looking more closely at the youtube video, it seems as if the shafts are 
	significantly beyond (in a front to back sense) the top of the disks at two points 
	in the disk rotation. So it is clear that the disks will not drive shafts that just 
	have a rounded end. Some sort of wider end or "shoe" will be necessary. The shoe 
	will need to be almost as long as the diameter of the cams on which they sit. The 
	simplest possible shoe might be 3/16" rods 1-2" long and cross drilled for the shaft. 
	This requires approximately 37" of 3/16"rod.
</p>

<p>
	The project will begin with the base. It will be 6" in diameter. I have a piece of 
	3/4" Baltic birch plywood left over from the door to the dodecahedron library and 
	a square 9" piece of 3/4" oak. I plan to make the base in two layers with the top 
	layer smaller in diameter and both layers decorated with some routing around the 
	edges. The top platforms will be made from 1/4" thick wood. They will be held 
	together and drilled for all of the brass rods. Similarly, the bottom and top 
	platforms will all be drilled together for the column positioning. The four columns 
	will be made from dowel rods if possible. Two will be drilled for the rotating shaft. 
	Next the 25 wheels will be cut from the aluminum round stock. They will all need to 
	have a center hole for elaboration of the edges. My plan at this point is to use the 
	rotary table held vertically with a fixture to hold the disks. A 1/4" ball end mill 
	will produce the semi-circular groove in the edges of the aluminum disks. These 
	disks will then be drilled 1/4" centered 1/4" from their edges. The disks will be 
	glued to the 1/4" shaft at the appropriate orientations. The four columns, the shaft 
	with disks, and the base need to be assembled prior to putting the top platforms on. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Water base.jpg" alt="Water droplet base" width="2098" height="1865">

<p>
	Two disks were cut with the table saw from 3/4" stock: one 7" and the other 6" in 
	diameter. After building a jig for routing the edges of disks the edges of both 
	disks were slightly decorated using two different router bits. They were then 
	glued face-to-face. Cut out a 6" circle from 3/4" oak and sanded the edge and the 
	faces as well as rounding the corners. The top and base were clamped together on 
	center. The center was found in the top disk using three lines to form a tiny 
	triangle. Two perpendicular lines were drawn through the center and marked at 3/8" 
	at the four ends of the lines. Holes (1/2") were drilled through the top and ~1/2" 
	into the base.
</p>

<p class=note>
	After drilling about 1/4" into the top for the last hole the pulley on the motor 
	shaft flew apart. Luckily both pieces missed me. Thank goodness I was wearing safety 
	glasses during the drilling!! A cover should be made for the pulleys and belts! Of 
	course the remainder of the pulley resists being removed. I think I have a spare 
	somewhere. I have a similarly sized pulley, but the bore diameter is 5/8" instead of 
	1/2". It also has a keyway. Buy or make a new one??
</p>

<p class=note>
	Purchased one online. After installing the noise that had been so evident when 
	running the drill press was gone! I had thought it was the spindle going bad, 
	when in fact it was just a misalignment between the two pulleys.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Broken pulley.jpg" alt="Broken pulley" width="1416" height="1428">

<p>
	The length of the support columns is the sum of the distance between the base and 
	top plus the thickness of the top plus the depth of the hole in the base. The 
	diameter of the largest wheel is 2" and the axle hole is 1/4" from the edge, so the 
	highest/lowest this wheel will be is 1 3/4" above the center of the axle. 2" 
	provides some leeway. Consequently, the distance between the base and the top should 
	be 4". Add 3/4" to this plus the depth of each hole and the columns should be 
	approximately 5 1/4". The top was separated from the base by 4" of scrap. The oak 
	dowel was inserted into a hole, marked and cut to fit. Each column and matching hole 
	were labelled as this can't be assembled until the shaft holding the disks is in 
	place.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Sizing columns.jpg" alt="Cutting columns to fit" width="1742" height="2165">
                                                                                                              
<p>
	A 3" length of 1 1/4" round aluminum was chucked in the four jaw chuck and aligned 
	with the aid of the dial indicator. A steady rest was used for support. The end was 
	faced, center drilled and drilled with a 1/4" drill to a depth of about 1". The 
	outside was lightly sanded and then two 3/16" lengths were parted off. The diameter 
	was reduced to 1.167" and two more disks were parted off. This was repeated for 
	1.083" and 1.000" with further drilling as needed. All eight disks were cleaned up, 
	the edges chamfered as well as the center hole.
</p>

<p class=note>
	The 1" disks will probably need their center holes plugged prior to drilling for the 
	cross shaft to keep the two holes from merging. Attaching/aligning the disks on the 
	shaft poses some problems. The original plan was to glue them to the shaft. But it 
	is unclear how to hold them in place while the glue dries. The alternative of using 
	a set screw tremendously increases the amount of work to make the disks, but 
	simplifies attachment.
</p>

<p>
	The center disk was made of 1/4" brass. A larger blank was reduced to 2" diameter, 
	chamfered on both sides, and sanded on the faces. The center hole was also chamfered. 
	The two 1" disks were plugged by gluing in 1/4" plugs.
</p>

<p>
	Six more disks were made from 3/16" X 1.5" flat aluminum stock. The aluminum was 
	cut into six squares with a hacksaw. Two were cut a little longer than 1.5". Centers 
	were carefully marked on all squares with a height gauge. The centers were drilled 
	up to 1/4" and the holes were lightly chamfered. The aluminum squares were placed 
	on a mandrel two at a time. The first pair was reduced to 1.332". The disks were 
	chamfered, removed, and sanded. The disks were returned to the mandrel in order to 
	chamfer the "inside" edges. This process was repeated for two 1.417" disks and for 
	two 1.499" disks. 
</p>

<p>
	The next set of disks were to be made from a 1 3/4" aluminum rod. A 2" length of this 
	was cut off in the bandsaw (still wandering from straight). Both ends were faced and 
	one end was drilled to 1/4" for a depth of 1 3/8". The hole was chamfered and the 
	diameter was reduced to 1.583" for a length of 0.48". The end was chamfered and a 
	disk was parted off at 0.188". Again the end was chamfered and a second disk was 
	parted off at 0.188". These disks were individually placed on the mandrel and the 
	rough edges were chamfered.
</p>

<p class=note>
	Parting off was extremely difficult and slow. There was significant chatter and on a 
	couple occasions the blade caught in the part yanking the part from the chuck. Part 
	of the problem is the rod has to be held in the reversed jaws with significantly less 
	holding ability. The blade was also yanked out of the holder twice and broke once.
</p>

<p>
	The four disks with diameters 1.833" and 1.916" were made from 2" X 3/16" flat stock 
	similarly to the disks above, though the corners were first removed from the starting 
	squares by hasksawing off the corners. This went quickly. Due to the parting issues, 
	the 1.667" and 1.750" disk pairs were made the same way.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Disks.jpg" alt="Completed disks" width="2277" height="2383">

<p>
	As opposed to the plan above, a cutter was made to cut the round groove in the edges 
	of the disks. The end of a length of tool steel was blued and a half circle was drawn 
	with a scribe around a 3/16" rod end. The tool was then ground to the line with a 
	7&deg; relief. The top of the tool bit was honed. The tool was placed in a holder 
	and used to cut the groove. There was significant chatter. The three-jaw chuck had 
	to be switched for a four-jaw chuck to provide better holding of the mandrel and 
	keep it from working out of the chuck. In the end it was best to just feed the cutter 
	in slowly and adjust the cross slide as needed. For the larger disks the cutter quit 
	producing chips and gave dust instead. Sharpening was tried, but was ineffective. 
	WD-40 was tried as cutting fluid and this seemed to do the trick. This allowed 6 
	disks to be cut. The last two disks did not fit over the cross slide, so they were 
	"grooved" with a round file using WD-40. Not great, but acceptable. The two smallest 
	disks had already been plugged and were placed between holding disks with gasket 
	material on them. The cutter was wide enough that it cut into the holding disks, but 
	this actually seemed to help as these disks were the easiest to cut. 
</p>

<p>
	The center brass disk was cut last and did utilize the strategy noted at the 
	beginning of this writeup. The rotary table was put on edge. A plate had to be 
	removed, a 3/8" brass tube was used for support, and the table was clamped to 
	the angle plate with C-clamps. A 1/4" round cutter made the groove in multiple 
	0.010" passes.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Grooved disks.jpg" alt="Completed grooved disks" width="2664" height="2436">

<p>
	Drilling the holes and deciding how to fix them to the shafts took some 
	consideration. Gluing the disks to the shaft was probably not an option as this 
	allows no modification in rotational position. Holding the disks in the proper 
	position while the glue dried would also be challenging. Consequently, cross 
	drilling and tapping for a set screw seemed the most appropriate approach, though 
	tedious, since it needs to be repeated 25 times. A good fit to the shaft was desired, 
	so the holes needed to be reamed 1/4". A 1/4" length of drill rod was selected for 
	the shaft. 
</p>

<p>
	The disks were placed in the vise in pairs on parallels. A small slip of paper was 
	used on one side so both were held tightly. The spindle was set 1/4" from the fixed 
	jaw in the back. The vise was centered under the spindle and as the disks were 
	placed in the vise they were adjusted to have the same distance from disk edge to 
	vise edge on both sides. The back edge of the vise was located and the spindle was 
	moved 1/4" in toward the cente of the disks. The hole was then drilled and reamed 
	1/4". 
</p>

<p>
	A fixture was needed to drill the disks for set screws. The angle plate was drilled 
	1/4" from the top edge on center with a 1/4" drill. Clamping this to the mill table 
	served as a simple, but effective fixture. A 1/4" length of drill rod was inserted 
	through this hole and a disk was then hung on the hole and clamped with machinist's 
	clamps. (After seeing some movement using one clamp two clamps were employed.) The 
	spindle was centered on the rod and moved out about 0.10" to the center of the disks. 
	The disks were three different thicknesses, so this distance was adjusted as needed. 
	Holes were started with a center drill, drilled with a #43 drill, and tapped 4-40. 
	This worked for all of the disks except for the brass center disk. It was too large 
	to fit on the fixture. The brass center disk was just held against the angle plate by 
	the two machinists clamps and aligned by eye. This worked well and all disks are now 
	completed. The 4-40 set screws ordered from Micro Fasteners arrived while we were in 
	Tulsa celebrating Oliver's second birthday. After installing the set screws and 
	placing the wheels in approximately the right orientation on a 1/4" shaft a picture 
	was taken.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Disks on shaft.jpg" alt="Disks placed on a shaft" width="2566" height="1847">

<p>
	After some checking on dimensions it is clear that the current posts are not far 
	enough apart to fit the disks (~4 3/4"). Consequently bearings will need to be made. 
	These bearings will need to have holes 2" above the base. The base is 6 1/2" in 
	diameter. A 2" line across the circle is about 1/4" inside the circle at the line's 
	center. If the bearings are 1/4" thick, then this will leave 5 1/2" of space between 
	the bearings for the disks. Per the calculation above 5 1/16" is needed. Securing 
	a bearing to the bottom disk with two screws will provide sufficient support across 
	the width of the bearing but not in the perpendicular direction. Consequently, a 
	decision was made to replace two of the columns with bottom to top disk bearing 
	supports. These will replace two of the current columns.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Support sketch.jpg" alt="Plan for support bearings" width="1609" height="2117">

<p>
	A 1/4" thick aluminum disk was available from making the dodecagon frames for the 
	orrery. This was marked out for two 1.5" X 4" rectangles and cut with a hacksaw. The 
	two long edges were squared up on both parts by clamping them with two C-clamps to 
	the angle plate in tandem. One edge was cut flat, the parts were turned over, 
	placed on parallels, and the opposite edge milled flat with the two insert end mill. 
	This left the parts 1.625" wide instead of the planned 1.5", but milling off another 
	0.125" at 0.010" per pass seemed too much work at 5:00 pm. The ends were milled with 
	a 3/8" end mill to a length of 4.055". All edges were lightly chamfered with a file.
</p>

<p>
	The only #8 screws in the shop are black hex heads, so some nicer #8's will need to 
	be purchased. Set up an aluminum plate clamped to the angle plate, flat to the table 
	and against a stop. Found the back, moved the spindle to the middle of the edge, 
	found the edge and moved the spindle in 3/16". A center drill was used followed by a 
	#15 (0.180) drill for clearance. The plate was then relocated in the same position 
	for the other three holes. This process was repeated on the second plate completing 
	the eight clearance holes for #8 screws.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Supports.jpg" alt="Supports" width="2510" height="2063">

<p>
	The four holes to make the radii in the corners were marked out 5/16" from the side 
	and 1/2" from the end. The aluminum was held on a block of wood clamped to the angle 
	plate with a parallel attached to the end for a stop. The holes were drilled to 
	13/32" starting with a center drill. One attempt to drill to 1/2" did not prove 
	successful. The holes were deburred on both sides.
</p>

<p>
	The center holes were marked out: 13/16" in from the sides and 2" inches from the 
	bottom. The two sides were held together in the vise and drilled to 1/4". These 
	holes were deburred. The bottom ends and the inside top were marked with a center 
	punch to maintain a common reference. One part was marked for cutting out the sides. 
	It was marked with lines from hole to hole on the long sides 7/16" in from the sides. 
	A hacksaw was used to cut a line into each hole. It was also used to cut to the 
	marked line about a hacksaws width from one saw kerf into a hole. A coping saw was 
	used to cut from the hole to the saw kerf at hacksaw width. The hacksaw was then 
	employed to finish the cut to the opposite hole. This was done with both parts 
	together in the vise: reference sides aligned. The rough cut parts are shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Rough cut supports.jpg" alt="Rough cut supports" width="2855" height="2369">

<p>
	The sides were placed in the vice with a scribed line parallel with the top of the 
	vise. The two insert cutter was used to cut to the line from hole to hole. The parts 
	were then placed in the vise on parallels with this cut side down. Luckily, the short 
	parallels fit within the "feet" of the supports. The top side was then also cut down 
	to the scribed line. While still in the vise the sides were further cut so that each 
	end flowed smoothly into the drilled hole. This left a 3/4" "square" in the center. 
	This was repeated on the other side. The ends were cut to match the holes as well, 
	but with a 3/16" end mill. The following photo shows the result of this 
	trimming.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Supports shaped.jpg" alt="Supports shaped" width="2666" height="1579">

<p>
	A support was placed on the rotary table in the mill after centering the mill with 
	the dial indicator. It was placed on a scrap of 1/16" brass sheet and held with a 
	vise clamp and a strap clamp. One side of the center section was turned to a 
	semicircle. The table was rotated about 120&deg;, cutting into the sides at each end 
	of the arc. The part was flipped to do the other side and the whole process was 
	repeated on the other support. It was then necessary to taper the sides to feather 
	into these undercuts.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Support undercuts.jpg" alt="Support after cutting arcs" width="1645" height="2720">

<p>
	A line was scribed from the undercut near center to the hole drilled near the 
	support's foot. The support was placed in the vise so the line was parallel with the 
	top of the vise jaws using a ruler. The support side was milled with the two-insert 
	end mill until the ends of the cut feathered into the round cuts. This was repeated 
	seven times to complete the support milling. The flat sides were sanded with 400 
	grit sandpaper.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Supports tapered.jpg" alt="Supports tapered" width="2666" height="1579">

<p>
	A support was centered in the 4-jaw chuck on the South Bend lathe using the tailstock 
	center. The hole was opened to 31/64" and then reamed 0.500". This was repeated on 
	the second support. The holes were lightly deburred. Made two bearings from 1/2" 
	bronze rod. A 1 1/2" piece was held in the chuck and faced. It was lightly chamfered 
	and drilled to 7/64" and to a depth of 3/4" followed by reaming to 0.250". Two bearings were parted off at 
	5/16" and all edges were lightly chamfered. The bearings were a nice slip fit in the 
	support holes. The bearings were glued into place (Loctite) with about 1/32" overhang 
	on each side.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Supports completed.jpg" alt="Supports completed with wheels" width="2457" height="2101">

<p>
	Four holes needed to be plugged as two supports were replaced by the bearing supports. 
	Plugs were cut on the lathe from a scrap of pine. They were cut slightly long and 
	pressed into the holes with glue. Used the random orbit sander with 80 grit paper 
	to quickly sand the plugs smooth with the mating surfaces.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Water current.jpg" alt="Water droplet temp assembly" width="2105" height="2171">

<p>
	I decided to use a brass inlay in the top so the drilled holes for the moving posts 
	will have better support than just the wooden top. The insert started from a 
	3/16" X 1 1/2" X 6 1/8" bar of brass stock. Arcs were marked at both ends 3 1/32" 
	from center. A center circle was marked with 3/8" radius. A center hole was drilled 
	and reamed to 1/4" for eventual use on the rotary table. Lines were marked from 
	where the arcs met the edge of the bar to points on the center circle 1/2" in from 
	the edge. The hacksaw was used to remove most of the material between these lines 
	and the edge of the stock. The insert was held edge up in the vise and the marked 
	line was aligned with the top edge of the vise by ruler. The outbound end was 
	supported with a machinist's jack and a piece of card stock was placed in the vise 
	to make sure the brass was evenly clamped. A 1/4" end mill was used to mill down 
	to the line. This was repeated on all four angled cuts leading to the insert shown 
	below.
</p>

<p>
	The rotary table was used to cut the arcs in the middle and the arcs on the ends of 
	the insert. A 3/16" long 1/4" plug was then cut to fit the hole drilled for the 
	rotary table work. The plug was glued in place with Loctite. A little touch up with 
	a file completed the insert. A little planning indicates that the insert should be 
	attached to the top before drilling the holes for the two aluminum support columns. 
	The columns can then be attached and marked for drilling on the bottom. This will 
	help assure that the rod holes are aligned with the wheels below. Saw a good video 
	online about inlay in wood. A dremel was used as a router to carefully cut the outline 
	and made a perfect pocket. A router base from StewMac was used, so I ordered one.
</p>

<p>
	With the router base in hand a trial cut was made first with a scrap piece of the 
	same wood. The brass part was outlined and the center was drilled with a 3/4" 
	Forstner bit. With the bit set to height the outline was routed. The router was 
	able to cut to the line with a little care. A smaller bit needs to be purchased to 
	make this even better at cutting to the line. After a little practice the brass 
	was clamped to the circular top and adjusted until it seemed to be accurately 
	squared to the two holes for the wood columns. It was clamped in place and outlined. 
	Both the brass insert and the top were marked to indicate the outlined orientation. 
	After removing the brass the top was clamped to the workbench and the router with 
	base was used to remove the bulk of the material. It was then used to cut to the 
	lines. A little chisel work was needed to clean up the lines yielding a tight fit 
	for the brass insert.

<p>
	The next step is attaching the aluminum supports to the top. After some effort to 
	carefully align and tighten up the disks, the distance between the two supports was 
	measured at 5 5/16". This is 1/8" over theoretical (even including the two bearings). 
	This is due to the disks not always laying completely flat against one another. The 
	other challenge noticed is that the weight is not distributed evenly and some 
	counterweights might be needed. If the total inside width is set at 5 3/8", then the 
	distance between the opposite support holes is 5 5/8" and the holes are on a 2.820" 
	hole circle. The distance between adjacent holes is 1 1/4".
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Aligned disks.jpg" alt="Disks aligned for measurement" width="2320" height="2667">

<p>
	The supports were aligned by eye with the edge of the top and with the brass insert. 
	A transfer punch was used to mark the four holes with clamps on two holes at a time. 
	After enlarging the punch marks with a hammer and punch the holes were drilled with 
	a #43 drill and then tapped (both wood and brass) 4-40. One inch long SHCS were used 
	to attach the top to the aluminum supports. The four holes were barely inside the 
	sides of the brass insert. In fact one actually broke through the side when tapping. 
	But when the brass insert was in place this was not noticeable. Whew! The top needed 
	to be a bit larger for comfort.
</p>

<p>
	The brass insert was removed and a center line was marked along its length. Holes 
	were then marked symmetrically around the center with a compass. The first hole was 
	marked 13/32" from center. The ensuing holes were marked 3/16" farther than the 
	previous hole; 19/32", 25/32", 31/32", &hellip; The holes were started with a small 
	center drill, followed by drilling with a #31 drill, and finally reaming with a 
	1/8" reamer. The insert was sanded to 1500 grit and polished with red rouge on a 
	cloth wheel. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Polished insert.jpg" alt="The polished brass insert" width="2374" height="2221">

<p>
	Using a 1/8" drill the holes were extended through the top wood disk with the insert 
	in place and serving as a drill guide. A cutting tool was needed to cut the rings 
	from a flat sheet of brass. To this end a two inch length of hack saw blade was cut 
	off with a Dremel and cutting wheel. This piece of blade had the teeth removed on 
	the grinding wheel and then one side was ground to an angle of about 11&deg;. The 
	sides of this cutting tool were very slightly ground. The tool is about 0.023" 
	thick. Nope, that did not work! The tool was shimmed to fit in the QCTP holder with 
	a 1/32" thick piece of brass. TA scrap piece of 1/16" brass sheet was cut to fit on 
	a 2 1/2" square block of wood and attached with carpet tape. The lathe was run at a 
	low speed. The tool was cutting to some extent, but with a lot of flex even though 
	there was less than 1/4" of tool exposed. As the tool went further into the brass 
	the brass was ripped from the carpet tape. A different approach will need to be 
	devised.
</p>

<p class="note">
	I assume these failures are due to the tool geometry. A boring tool has significant 
	relief just below the cutting point. This is because the curve of the hole being cut 
	will rub against the tool if this is not present. None of the tools used to cut this 
	between ring gap have sufficient relief to avoid the rubbing. And this leads to the 
	chatter and inability to cut properly.
</p>

<p>
	So, if I can't use a thin blade to cut all of the disks from a single piece of brass 
	stock, then I will need to use at least two 5" squares of stock to cut out the rings. 
	They will be cut individually and alternate rings will come from alternate stock. 
	This way I can make them 3/16" wide without worrying about the cutter width. The 
	total width of the drilled holes (center to center) is 4 15/16", so the largest ring 
	needs to be 4 15/16" + 3/16". The outside radii of the required disks are: 2 9/16", 
	2 3/8", 2 3/16", 2", 1 13/16", 1 5/8", 1 7/16", 1 1/4", 1 1/16", 7/8", 11/16", and 
	1/2". A cutoff tool or a fairly pointed tool will be used to cut close to the I.D. 
	and then the disk will be bored to the requisite inside diameter. Standard tooling 
	will be used to cut the disk to the outside diameter. The 5 1/4" square plate will 
	be used for the 2 9/16", 2 3/16", 1 13/16", 1 7/16", 1 1/16", and 11/16" rings. 
</p>

<p>
	The plate was marked for the inside and outside of the six rings to be cut out. The 
	5 1/4" plate was attached to a 5" square block of 3/4" plywood with double sided 
	tape. The corners were cut off leaving a rough octagon. It was marked and drilled 
	for three holes to fit the face plate of the Sherline lathe. Three #6 screws with 
	two washers were used to hold the block to the face plate. The headstock riser block 
	was inserted and the cutting tools were mounted on the homemade 1 1/14" mounting 
	block. The center mark was aligned to the center of the cutting tool.  A groove was 
	attempted between the outermost and next ring. The first tool tried was the 
	tangential tool. It was too obtuse as were the HSS insert tool and the 30&deg; tool. 
	The cutoff blade was not set up, so I switched to cutting the outside of the 
	outermost ring with the tangential tool. This was done in 0.005" increments, due to 
	the intermittent cutting action. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	Almost reached the OD of the outer ring when the plate came loose from the plywood! 
	Time to switch to the rotary table on the mill and use a 1/8" end mill to remove 
	the brass between the rings!
</p>

<p>
	The rotary table was squared up on the table and the center hole was indicated in 
	with the dial indicator (turning the spindle). The brass disk was pressed back down 
	on the carpet tape covered wooden block. A 3/8" hole was drilled through the disk 
	and the block. The block was then attached to the rotary center with a screw and nut. 
	The table was moved out on the y-axis and the outside of the disk was reduced 
	slightly to the required 2 9/16" radius. The table was moved a further 5/16" to 
	place the 1/8" end mill just to the inside of the first ring. A 1/8" hole was 
	drilled and after switching to the end mill it was lowered into the hole in 
	increments of 0.010" followed by rotating the table through a full 360&deg;. The 
	1/8" gap produced by cutting off the outermost ring was widened 0.065" in 10-15 
	thou increments. The last 0.005" was climb milled to leave a better finish on the 
	outside of the second ring. The table was moved 0.310" (slightly less then 5/16" 
	making up for the extra taken off of the outside). A 1/8" hole was drilled and the 
	groove was milled to depth and width as before. Below is a picture of the first 
	ring cut loose from the disk and the gap to the second ring finished to width.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/First ring.jpg" alt="First ring cut loose" width="2566" height="2542">

<p>
	The process was repeated producing 5 rings: 5 1/8", 4 3/8", 3 5/8", 2 7/8", and 
	2 1/8" in diameter. The final ring, 1 3/8",  was removed from the block of wood 
	and bored to 1" ID. The second set of rings were cut from a 5" X 5" blank. The 
	center was marked and drilled 1/4" and the rings were marked on the brass with a 
	ruler and scribe. The outside of the first ring was cut in one pass with the 1/8" 
	end mill. The end mill was aligned with the edge of the disk 1/8" from the edge 
	of the blank. The blank was moved slowly into the end mill at full depth and when 
	the end mill was aligned with the outermost mark the rotary table was rotated for 
	360&deg;. It took about 30 minutes but was quite effective with minimal chatter. 
	The remainder of the rings were made as above with the smallest ring drilled to 
	3/8" and bored to 5/8". The rings need significant cleanup and sizing to fit well 
	together.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Another project that really needed a DRO.
</p>

<p>
	Almost two years later and the project has risen back to the top of my list. After 
	some careful measuring the five rings that need some work were selected. The goal is 
	to end up with a difference in diameters of about 0.025". The rings were labeled to 
	distinguish those that need inside cuts from those that need outside cuts. A support 
	block was made from a 6"&nbsp;X&nbsp;6" block of 3/4"oak. A 2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2" 
	clamping block was attached to the back on center. Circles were marked out on the 
	face of the oak block to facilitate alignment of the rings for cutting. The first 
	ring was placed in position on pieces of double sided tape. 
</p>

<p>
	The clamping block was clamped in the four jaw chuck on the South Bend lathe. The 
	center of the block was marked to make the circles and this mark was used for initial 
	alignment via the tail stock. A dial gauge mounted on a magnetic stand was used to 
	center the ring. The only cutter I had that had sufficient front rake was the thread 
	cutting tool. This was mounted in the lathe so that it pointed into the inside of the 
	ring. Multiple attempts were made to remove the 0.012" from the inside of this ring, 
	before I realized that the ring was moving side to side. The small surface area of 
	tape was not sufficient to hold it in place. Strap clamps need to be added to the 
	workholding jig.
</p>

<p>
	I found a 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;4" block of aluminum in the scrap. This 
	was long enough to make four strap clamps. Two opposite sides were faced with the 
	3/4" two-insert cutter as they had been sawed at some point in the past. The same 
	cutter was used to cut four 1/16" deep slots across the last side faced. These slots 
	were then chain drilled on center: three holes with a 7/32" drill (the through drill 
	size for a #10 screw). The holes were milled to produce four slots each about 0.6" 
	long. The bar was then cut into four clamps with the hacksaw. The clamps were 
	deburred and the sawn ends were filed. The two pictures show the clamps being cut 
	apart and after deburring. The clamps are taller than needed, but reducing them to 
	the desired 1/4" would have taken too much time. With luck this won't be needed.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Strap clamps finished.jpg" alt="Four strap clamps completed" width="2050" height="1322">

<p>
	Multiple different locations for three or four clamps will be needed to clamp the 
	five rings to be cut. The locations of the holes not only depend on the size of the 
	ring, but also on whether the ring will be cut on the inside or the outside. Twelve 
	holes were drilled to anchor the clamps with a #21 drill. Four 1" long 10-32 SHCS 
	were selected, so the holes were tapped 10-32. The picture below shows the clamps in 
	place for cutting the largest ring. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Ring clamped.jpg" alt="Ring clamped with the strap clamps" width="1529" height="1621">

<p>
	The large ring was reduced by 0.015" in 0.005" increments. It fits well outside the 
	next size ring. The tool geometry is not ideal and I think I just got away with it 
	on this ring. For the next ring of smaller diameter I could not adjust the tool so 
	the bottom of the tool would not rub. I will use the 1/4" boring bar from the 
	Sherline. It is really too short and needs to be shimmed with three strips of 
	aluminum. However, it has the correct geometry and should work. It squealed a lot 
	but the ring was cut to fit. The 3/8" left hand cutter was then used for the next 
	three rings reduced from the outside. The pictures below show the rings that were 
	cut and the entire group of rings. (The happy guy is me!)

<p>
	While thinking about the best way to drill the holes in the rings for attaching the 
	sliding rods, I looked at the drilled holes in the top plate. They were drilled and 
	reamed 1/8". Neither a punch nor 1/8" drill rod fit in the holes. I have some brass 
	rod nominally 1/8" that measures slightly under 0.124". It is a very tight fit. The 
	holes in the wood are just as tight even after reaming. I do not see how 
	to transfer the holes to the rings, but these 1/8" holes won't work as currently 
	configured. Short of redrilling the holes at a larger size, thinner material for the 
	sliding rods is needed. 
</p>

<p>
	I don't think a little free play should be a problem, so I will purchase 3/32" rod. 
	The distance from the top of a small cam at its lowest point 
	to the top of the support is 1&nbsp;3/4". With the 3/4" top the minimum length of the 
	sliding rods is 2&nbsp;1/2". The shoes at 3/16" thick can be ignored. Any length 
	longer than 2&nbsp;1/2" is how high the rings will float above the top plate. The 
	video noted above shows the rings about 2" above the top. That aligns with the 4.5"
	in the plan above. Twenty-five rods are required resulting in 112.5" of brass rod.
	The length of a shoe needs to be the diameter of the cam on which it sits. The sum 
	of the diameters of the aluminum wheels is 35". The brass cam is 2" in diameter. A 
	minimum of 37" of 3/16" brass round is required for the brass shoes. The metal was 
	ordered on 8/23/20.
</p>

<p>
	I will wait on the brass for the sliding rods before drilling the rings. I want to 
	make sure the 3/32" rods will be sturdy enough to function as the sliding rods. 
	Drilling the holes will probably be done with a three jaw chuck attached to the 
	indexing table. Each time a ring is drilled, a machinist's jack or some other device 
	will be used for support. The plan is to attach the sliding rods to the rings by 
	soldering. A jig will be made to make sure the sliding rods are perpendicular to 
	the ring. It will need to be made from steel. Aluminum will solder to brass if there 
	is no aluminum oxide on the surface.
</p>

<p>
	A 1" square piece of stock was located in the garage. Two 1&nbsp;1/4" lengths were 
	cut off with the band saw. They were both faced on the cut ends in the South Bend 
	lathe. One of the pieces was offset so the center of the part was 7/32" from a side. 
	The part was center drilled and than drilled through with a 5/16" drill. This puts 
	one edge of the hole 1/8" from the nearest edge. The second part was mistakenly also 
	drilled through with the 5/16" drill. This part was then opened up with a 13/32" 
	drill for 1/2" to receive the screw. (If need be it can be plugged on the far end.)
	The other part was tapped 3/8-16. The corners were all filed and the holes were 
	chamfered.
</p>

<p>
	A 6" length of threaded rod (3/8-16) was cut off and the ends faced and chamfered in 
	the lathe. Three 3/8-16 nuts were found in the drawers. After measuring, a 3/32" hole 
	was drilled in each block. They were 1/4" from the ends and 3/16" from the bottom. 
	The holes were lightly chamfered. The picture shows the jig assembled.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Ring jig.jpg" alt="Jig for drilling and soldering the rings" width="1445" height="1409">

<p>
	The jig needs to be set from the holes already drilled in the insert. To do this 
	pins need to be made. Either the holes in the bottom of the jig can be opened to 
	1/8" or the pins can be reduced on one end to 3/32". The latter tack will be tried 
	first. Two 1" lengths of 1/8" drill rod were cut off with a hacksaw. After facing a 
	pin was held in a collet in the lathe and about 3/4" was reduced to 0.124" with 
	sandpaper. The pin was flipped and the other end was faced and then 1/4" was reduced 
	to 0.094". This fit nicely in the drilled hole in the jig. The other pin was made 
	the same way. The fat ends of the pins were inserted in the widest holes in the 
	insert. The jig was placed on the reduced ends and the lock nut was tightened. The 
	jig was placed on a piece of paper and a 3/32" transfer punch was used to mark the 
	paper through the jig's holes. The marks were measured at 4&nbsp;15/16". The pins 
	were measured and gave the same length. The picture below shows the pins used in 
	the insert for setting the jig.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Ring jig pins.jpg" alt="Pins for setting the ring jig" width="1945" height="1187">


<p>
	The rings were marked for holes. Two rulers were used to mark a line across the 
	halfway point, by setting the scribe ruler halfway from the top and bottom with the 
	second ruler. The distance between holes was then measured and centered as best as 
	possible. Some of the holes will be drilled quite near the edges of the rings.
</p>

<p class="note">
	In hindsight it would have been better to have drilled the holes in the rings first, 
	where the most variation exists. Then the holes could have been readily transfered to 
	the insert.
</p>

<p>
	It might be possible to either punch the spot or center drill it very shallowly. A 
	block from the jig could then be center over the hole with the aid of a center punch. 
	Clamping and then drilling through the block would keep the drill from wandering off 
	center. A custom made finger plate would be ideal.
</p>

<p>
	With the <a href= "Custom finger plate.html">custom finger plate</a> in hand, 
	it was time to test it out. First the rings needed to be cleaned up from the lathe 
	work. Acetone and then mineral spirits were used to remove the carpet tape glue. 
	Files were used to deburr the inside and outside edges of the rings. Two stops 
	were established on the milling table. One consisted of three rulers and a parallel 
	wedged into the back tee slot. The second was another finger plate clamped to the 
	table on the left side. The new custom finger plate was placed against the two stops 
	and clamped in place. The 3/32" drill was centered over the drill insert.
</p>

<p>
	The plate was removed and the largest ring was placed on the plate. The pencil lines 
	were centered with the small dot in the center of the "eyepiece". The ring was 
	clamped in place with the finger clamp. The plate was reinserted against the stops 
	and clamped in place. The hole was carefully drilled. The picture below shows the 
	plate in place after drilling a hole.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Ring hole drilled.jpg" alt="Drilling a hole in a ring" width="2548" height="1430">

<p>
	The plate was removed from the clamps, the ring was removed and the entire process 
	was repeated an additional 23 times. After each pair of holes had been drilled in a 
	ring, they were deburred and the hole separation was checked with the pins in the 
	brass insert. Some were a little tight, but all could be fit on the pins. Most 
	importantly, the hole locations marked right at the edge of the ring were still 
	accurately drilled without wandering off the edge.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Ring holes drilled.jpg" alt="All 24 ring holes drilled" width="2029" height="1128">

<p>
	Making pins is next in line. The distance from the axle to the top of the top is 
	2&nbsp;3/4". The desired height of the rings above the top is about 1". The rods 
	will all be 4" long. The rods will be flat on one end and threaded 2-56 on the other. 
	In order to clean up the ends, trim the rods to length, reduce one end to 0.086", 
	and thread this end, a collet is needed. The smallest ER-32 collet I have is 1/8". 
	But the ER-32 collets will tighten down as much as 0.039", giving me 0.008" leeway. 
	I will test this hypothesis out before I cut any of the rods.
</p>

<p>
	The 1/8" collet clamps tightly on the 3/32" stock. It should have been a 
	straightforward process to thread one end, move the stock out of the collet by 4" 
	and cut off a part. Unfortunately, opening and closing the collet is a bear. This 
	is mainly because I do not have a 1&nbsp;1/2" open end wrench or an adjustable 
	wrench that opens more than 1&nbsp;1/4". So I have to use a pair of adjustable 
	pliers with some aluminum between the jaws. It takes more time to open and close 
	the collet than it does to cut the threads or part off the part. I got seven 
	completed after about two hours of work. I will get back to the rest this afternoon.
</p>

<p class="note">
	One saving grace is that I do not need to reduce the part by 0.008" before cutting 
	the threads. The die seems to work fine on the 3/32" brass stock as long as it is 
	tightly clamped in the collet.
</p>

<p>
	The remaining rods were made (26 total). A hacksaw was used instead of the parting 
	tool saving one open/close of the collet. One extra was made and the rod for the drop 
	of water was cut about an inch longer than the rest. (Just in case. After reviewing 
	the video above it is pretty clear that the water drop rod is the same length.) It is 
	not clear to me how much sanding and polishing needs to be done prior to soldering. 
	Some work along these lines will need to be done after soldering, but it might be 
	easiest to do most of it before soldering. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	One item I don't want to forget to take care of is a counterweight for the heavy 
	brass disk. An alternative would be to drill holes in this disk. Many of the 
	aluminum disks are also on the same side of the shaft as the brass disk further 
	overbalancing the shaft. The brass disk will also need to be polished as well as 
	the larger aluminum disks.
</p>

<p>
	Sanded the rings with 600 and 1000 grit paper on both sides. After 1.5 hours I had 
	to stop sanding as my hand began to cramp up. The 25 feet were cut 0.25" less than 
	the wheel diameters with a hacksaw from a 36" length of 3/16" brass rod.
</p>

<p class="note">Decided to wait until the feet have been made before the rods are trimmed 
	to the final length. The threaded ends are not identically threaded so some may sit 
	deeper in the feet than others. 
</p>

<p>
	The ends of the feet will be cleaned up and rounded prior to drilling for the rods. 
	The radius cutter was set up on the lathe. The third hole from the end was selected. 
	A better choice would have been the second as the fixture got very close to the 
	spinning chuck for the short feet. The tool was set on top of the part and the 
	set screws were tightened. Each of the 25 feet had radii cut on both ends over two 
	hours. About 2&nbsp;1/2 minutes per radius. The picture below shows the radiused

<p>
	The feet were each marked at half their length with a dial caliper. The spindle of 
	the mill was aligned with the vertical v-groove. A foot was inserted in the 
	horizontal v-groove and the amount of the foot buried in the v-groove was determined. 
	The spindle was then aligned in the y-direction by moving away from the vertical 
	jaw by 0.094" - 0.019" = 0.075". A marked foot was inserted and the mark aligned by 
	eye with the vertical v-groove. The foot was center drilled, drilled through with a 
	#45 drill, and tapped 2-56 all the way through the foot. The tapping was started 
	with the tap in the spindle, but after a few threads were cut the tapping was 
	finished with the <a href="Tiny tap wrench.html">tiny tap wrench</a>. 
	All 25 feet were finished in about 3 hours. The pictures below show the tapping 
	operation and the completed (but for polishing) set of feet.

<p>
	In order to correctly set the lengths of the rods the length needs to be measured 
	while the rod is attached to the foot. For this purpose the rods were <em>mated</em> 
	to the feet and marked. The feet all have numbers so the rods had lines marked across 
	the rod of an equal number. Half of the feet and their mating rods were also marked 
	with a dot. The important aspect of this length is that all pairs are the same, 
	otherwise the ring held by that pair will be tilted.
</p>

<p>
	While deciding how best to adjust the bar length, I considered how best to 
	counterbalance the heavy brass disk. Drilling holes in the brass disk would be 
	easiest, but it is not clear how much weight needs to be removed. It is also not easy 
	to determine how much weight is needed to add for a counterbalance. The ideal 
	approach is to have an adjustable counterbalance. Two steel disks should serve this 
	purpose. Two because they need to balance each other out as well. 
</p>

<p>
	The density of brass is 0.3 lbs/cubic in, while aluminum is 0.1 and steel is 0.28. 
	If I only consider the largest two aluminum disks as currently providing a 
	counterbalance to the brass disk. (i.e. we assume the other aluminum disks cancel 
	each other out.) These aluminum disks are 1.9" in diameter and 3/16" thick. So the 
	weight of these aluminum disks is 0.054 lbs. The brass disk at 2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/4" 
	weighs 0.236 lbs. So 3/4's of the brass disk would need to be removed if drilling. 
</p>

<p>
	To further complicate matters the center of the disk relative to the axle needs to 
	be included. The center of the brass disk is 0.75" from the axle. So 3/4's of its 
	moment is 0.133 lb-in. If we use steel disks as counterweights and assume that the 
	steel disk centers are 0.5" from the axle center, then the radius of the steel disks 
	is 0.891". In other words two 1.78" disks are needed to counterbalance 3/4's of the 
	brass disk. If that is too much weight the disks can be rotated so they are no longer 
	opposite the brass disk. (with one disk rotating up and one down) This is a fairly 
	easy and nondestructive experiment to run, if I can find some appropriate steel.
</p>

<p>
	A 1&nbsp;1/2" steel rod was found in the garage. Two approximately 3/16" disks were 
	cut off with the bandsaw. (A very slow drop rate gave a very straight cut.) The 
	disks were individually chucked in the Sherline 3-jaw chuck with the jaws reversed. 
	They were set on two drills (1/16") to provide enough material above the jaws. The 
	first attempt at facing was with the QCTP and the insert cutter. The chatter was bad, 
	so I switched to the Sherline lathe tool in the standard tool holder. The cuts went 
	without chatter. Each side of both disks was faced in this way. A hole was drilled 
	and reamed 1/4" in the center of each disk. The disks were then placed on a 1/4" 
	mandrel and the outside was cleaned. The edges and center hole were lightly chamfered.
</p>

<p>
	The disks were placed in the milling vise on parallels and held tight with a strip 
	of cardboard. A 1/4" shaft was used to align the spindle with the center hole. The 
	x-axis was then moved 0.500" to drill the hole for the axle. The disks were center 
	drilled, drilled with a C drill, and then reamed 1/4". The hole was deburred. The 
	disks were individually stood upright in the vise. The 1/4" rod was aligned with 
	this new hole and used to find the back of the disk. The y-axis was then adjusted 
	1/8" plus half the thickness of the disk (0.168"). The disk was then drilled #38 
	and tapped for the 5-40 set screw. After a little clean-up the counterbalance disks 
	were completed as seen the the following photo.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Counterbalance disks.jpg" alt="Two disks to counterbalance the brass disk" width="2105" height="1873">

<p>
	Half of the disks were removed from the axle and the steel disks were inserted on 
	either side of the brass disk. They extended directly opposite the brass disk. This 
	should be the maximum counterbalance effect. The brass disk is still heavier than 
	the other disks, though not by much. Plugging the still disks might be enough added 
	weight to completely negate the extra weight of the brass disk. A 0.610" brass rod, 
	1/4" in diameter, was added spanning the two steel disks through their center holes. 
	It was still not enough weight. 
</p>

<p>
	The shaft between the steel counterweight disks was used to suspend weight. When the 
	various weights balanced the brass disk, their combined weight was approximated by 
	determining their volume and multiplying by density. (aluminum: 0.098 lb/in<sup>3</sup>, 
	brass: 0.311 lb/in<sup>3</sup>, steel: 0.284 lb/in<sup>3</sup>) This weight was 
	suspended at 1/2" from the axle. The two steel disks were also centered 1/2" from 
	the axle. A little math indicated that if the two steel disks were centered at 0.88" 
	from the axle, they should balance the brass disk. 
</p>

<p>
	Half of the disks were removed from the axle and the steel disks were attached to 
	their neighboring aluminum disks with carpet tape. The loose disks were reattached 
	to the axle mirroring the arrangement of the affixed disks. The photo below shows 
	the steel disks attached and the balance between the brass disk and steel disks. Of 
	course now the axle likes to stay in a position where these disks are horizontally 
	arranged. But it does seem easier to rotate the axle. I have not decided how best to 
	permanently attach the steel disks to the aluminum disks.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Counterbalance disks taped.jpg" alt="Two disks to counterbalance the brass disk taped in place" width="1317" height="1789">

<p class="note">
	The gap between the aluminum disks and the brass disk they flank should be 0.188". 
	Since the steel disks are slightly thinner than that, I have been using a card when 
	affixing the steel disks to provide a little extra separation between these disks.
</p>

<p>
	Returned to the rods and feet. They were all measured. Most are right about 1/16" 
	longer than 4". One is 4.000". One is 4.017" and one is 4.118". A stop was used, but 
	provided little value unless a rod needed to be returned to the lathe for more 
	reduction. The stop was the taper removal tool from the mill with a long strap clamp 
	screw as the stop. It was just barely long enough for these rods. Since the rods 
	were measured with the foot on, the stop could not be routinely used. All of the 
	rods were reduced to 4.00" as measured with the foot.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Rods cut to length.jpg" alt="All of the rods after cutting to length" width="1731" height="1668">

<p>
	The remaining tasks are: polish the rods, feet and rings, solder the rods to the 
	rings, clean up the soldering, polish the cams and the insert, finish the wood, 
	attach the steel disks with screws, make a handle, make the water drop, and assemble. 
	The water drop was made next. A 1/2" length of brass round was chucked in the lathe 
	and the radius tool was used to put a half sphere on the end. The half ball was 
	parted off at 1/2" after drilling and threading the hole 2-56. A short brass screw 
	(2-56) was made. the half ball was put on the screw and the other half was cut part 
	way when the screw broke off in the ball!! A second half ball was made as before and 
	this time a steel screw was used instead of brass. In addition very light cuts were 
	taken to produce the ball shown in the following photo. A rod was shortened and 
	threaded on the second end to complete the final rod. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Water drop.jpg" alt="Water drop on its rod" width="1710" height="682">

<p>
	A 1&nbsp;1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;5" piece of 1/16" brass plate was found. The brass was 
	painted with Dykem blue. A handle was laid out on the brass with the help of a 
	French curve draftsman's tool and a 3/8" washer. This is seen in the first photo below. 
	A hacksaw was used to remove most of the material. Most of the remainder was filed 
	to the line with a half-round file. A few places were filed with small files and the 
	entire edge was cleaned up with a small half round file. The resulting handle is 
	shown in the second photo.

<p>
	I couldn't resist and had to put it together at its current stage. A photo of the 
	partially assembled device is below. A few issues were noticed. The center hole for 
	the water drop rod is 1/8" in the brass insert, but 1/4" in the wood. This needs to 
	be plugged and drilled 1/8" Currently as the cams move this foot wanders all over. A 
	second issue is the frame. When the screws holding the aluminum supports were fully 
	tightened the shaft would no longer turn. Leaving them just tight enough was fine. 
	It is not clear if the cams need deeper grooves for the feet. The feet do jump out 
	at times. The weight of the rings and the alignment they provide may make this a 
	non-issue.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Water drop partial assembly.jpg" alt="The water drop automaton partially assembled" width="1796" height="2437">

<p>
	The first task tackled is completing the handle. The mechanism was taken completely 
	apart to get access to the shaft. A square is to be cut on the end to hold the handle 
	firmly. A jig was made to accomplish this accurately. An old puzzle part was made 
	from 1/2" square aluminum bar. The center was marked on the end. The stock was 
	centered in the four-jaw chuck by aligning the marked center with a tailstock center. 
	The end was center drilled and then drilled 1/4" about half-way through. It was only 
	drilled this far due to the center cutout, which might cause significant deflection 
	of the drill. The part was carefully reversed in the chuck and drilled from the other 
	end. The hole was reamed all the way through. The shaft was a tight fit so the hole 
	was opened with an F drill to 0.256". The shaft then fit nicely. After deburring the 
	part was marked for set screw holes, 1/4" from the end and centered. (Used the new 
	adjustable marking tool.) Holes were drilled with a #43 drill and tapped 4-40. The 
	photo below shows the shaft in the jig.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Squaring jig.jpg" alt="A squaring jig for a 1/4 in shaft" width="1239" height="824">

<p>
	To use the jig the depth of cut needs to be determined. The Circle Calculations tool 
	from above was used to determine the correct depth of cut for squaring the circle. 
	The radius, 1/8", was entered as was the total vee angle, 90&deg;. This gave 0.037" 
	as the depth of cut to make the inscribed square. I had significant problems with 
	the Z-axis adjustments on the mill. The backlash is about 0.020"! I was unable to 
	correct this. I ended up with more of a rectangle than a square. The 1/16" thick 
	brass handle was drilled about 0.15, the smaller dimension of the rectangle. The 
	rectangle was created with a small triangular file and fits well. The end of the 
	shaft was drilled and tapped for a 4-40 button head screw.
</p>

<p>
	A knob was made from a 1&nbsp;5/8" length of 1/2" bronze rod. One end was faced, 
	center drilled, drilled through with a 0.166" drill, and then countersunk with a 
	0.228" drill for the head of a 6-32 screw. The part was turned around in the 
	chuck. The headstock was set at 6&deg;. The end was reduced to 0.25" providing a 
	pleasing taper. The small end was chamfered. The knob was parted off at 1.25". The 
	new end was chamfered prior to completing the parting. The holes were deburred and 
	the length of the knob was sanded with 600 and 1500 grit paper. The handle 
	assembly attached to the shaft is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Water handle.jpg" alt="The assembled knob, handle and shaft" width="1735" height="1215">

<p>
	The 1/16" brass handle was sanded with 600 grit paper followed by the brown crocus 
	paper. This geve it a nice polish. The handle is complete except for further 
	polishing. A 1/4" wooden dowel was glued into the center of the wooden top and left 
	to dry over night.
</p>

<p>
	The rings were sanded again this morning with 1500 grit paper. The rings, rods, 
	feet, and other parts were polished on the cloth wheel with red rouge. The rings 
	were polished on both faces and the outside edge. The rods and feet polished 
	nicely with no sanding. The water drop was polished as were the handle and knob. A 
	photo shows the polished parts. One of each foot size was marked on both the foot 
	and the rod with a Sharpie. With the marks the feet can be removed for soldering.
</p>

<p>
	Soldering day!! The process was straightforward, the implementation was not. The jig 
	was set via the pins and the insert at the correct separation. The jig was held in 
	garage vise. Duct tape was put on a rod and the rod was pushed up through the jig and 
	the ring. It was secured with tape. A small piece of solder was placed on the end of 
	the rod as well as a drop of flux (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>). The ring, rod and solder was 
	heated with a blow torch until the solder melted. This process was repeated for all 
	24 rods. In each case the foot was on the rod and was aligned tangent to the ring 
	when fully tightened. 
</p>

<p>
	Numerous problems arose during the process. Taping was not easy and eventually the 
	best way was wrapping tape around the rod, inserting the rod, and pressing the free 
	end of the tape onto the end of the jig. On occasion the solder would not melt. It 
	was then necessary to add a second piece of solder. Keeping the end of the rod 
	aligned with the top of the ring was not easy as the tape did not stick well to the 
	steel end of the jig. The process was slow, but all 24 joints were completed in four 
	hours. One joint was loose and had to be re-soldered. Below is a photo of the set of 
	rings with rods attached.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/WD soldered rods.jpg" alt="The rods soldered to the rings" width="1911" height="2090">

<p>
	After soldering the ring-rod assemblies were washed with soapy water to get rid of 
	any remaining flux. They were rinsed well and dried. The soldered joints were then 
	sanded with 1000 and 1500 grit sand paper. A file was also used in cases of excess 
	solder. 
</p>

<p>
	Decided to polish this morning the soldered rings. Probably not a good choice in 
	retrospect. The ring with the bad solder was no better when I picked it up to polish. 
	The join is still flexible. A second join was also weak. Both were close to the edge. 
	While soldering one of the larger rings it caught on the wheel. The damage can be 
	seen in the following photo. The bent ring was flattened in the vise and seemed to be 
	reasonably back to shape. The two rings with loose rods were re-soldered and the rods 
	were soldered back in place on the bent ring. It was sanded to 2000 grit along with 
	the rest of the rings that had not been polished. (I planned to polish them with the 
	rotary tool.) Upon setting the not quite so bent ring in the next size up, I 
	discovered it no longer fits. It is out of round!!
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/Bent ring.jpg" alt="The bent ring after catching on the wheel" width="1402" height="1357">

<p>
	The larger ring is 4&nbsp;3/4" ID. The next size smaller ring is 4&nbsp;5/16" OD. 
	The new ring needs to be 4&nbsp;3/8" ID (minimum) and 4&nbsp;11/16" OD (maximum). 
	One attempt was made and failed. On the second attempt a 4&nbsp;3/4" square of 1/32" 
	brass was cut with a hacksaw. The ring was laid out on this brass using dykem and 
	a compass. The brass plate then had its corners removed with the hacksaw to give a 
	rough octagon. This was taped (double sided tape) to a square of 3/4" oak. A center 
	hole was drilled 3/8" all the way through the brass and wood.
</p>

<p>
	The rotary table was aligned with the milling spindle. A recently made brass screw 
	center pip was first aligned with a tailstock center held in a drill chuck. The 
	alignment was further refined with the dial gauge. The first method was within 0.010" 
	and the second method brought this down to less than 0.001". The block was held on 
	the rotary table with the brass screw and two washers. The table was moved off 
	center with the y-axis hand wheel by fifty turns. This set the outside edge of the 
	5/16" end mill even with the outside edge of the ring. The handwheel was then moved 
	a further six turns out and cutting began. The entire depth was cut with each turn. 
	The handwheel was advanced 0.010" per pass to get back to the original position on 
	the outside edge of the ring. The next size ring fit nicely around this new ring.
</p>

<p>
	The table was advanced back toward center 0.358". This put the spindle 1/16" past 
	the inside of the ring. (0.140" wide ring) A center drill followed by a 1/8" drill 
	produced the starting hole for the end mill. The 1/8" end mill was lowered 0.010" 
	per pass. I made sure the last pass was completely through. When the last pass was 
	about 3/4 complete two clamps were placed on the brass and block to make sure the 
	ring did not come loose. The ring was then freed from the inner circle of brass. 
	The next lower size ring fit comfortably within this new ring. A picture of the 
	new ring is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/New ring.jpg" alt="A new ring to replace the bent ring" width="1774" height="1875">

<p>
	The edges of the new ring were deburred and the glue and dykem were removed with 
	acetone. The ring was sanded to 2000 grit and marked for drilling. The drilling jig 
	was used and the holes drilled to match the holes on the insert. The rods from the 
	bent ring were unsoldered and soldered into the new ring using the same procedure 
	as above. The completed ring with rods is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/New ring with rods.jpg" alt="The new ring with rods soldered" width="1412" height="1723">

<p>
	The new ring was sanded, 1000 to 2000 grit. It and the other rings that were not 
	polished on the buffing wheel were buffed with a 1" felt disk attached to the 
	Dremel. Red rouge was used. These rings are definitely not as shiny as the others. 
	The rings and all of the other buffed parts were neutralized with a baking soda 
	solution. The parts were then rinsed and washed with soapy water. Finally, the parts 
	were wiped with isopropyl alcohol. Everything except the feet were painted with 
	Protecta-clear. The next photo shows the painted parts. A second coat was painted on 
	an hour later before I grilled the salmon.
</p>

<p>
	The feet were strung on a thread. The thread was tied to supports with holes in 
	their ends. The supports were clamped to the work table. The feet were then painted. 
	The water drop was screwed onto its shaft and the shaft clamped between two pieces of 
	wood. All were painted with two coats of the P-C varnish. The photo shows the painted 
	feet.
</p>

<img class=inline src="watDrop/WD painted feet.jpg" alt="First coat of varnish on feet" width="2192" height="916">

<p>
	Sanded the base, top, and legs with 100 and 150 grit paper. These wooden parts were
	stained with Sedona Red stain. It is redder than I remember. I may put a coat of 
	brown stain over the red. I will decide after they have dried in six hours. Went for 
	the second color, a dark walnut. This toned the red down nicely. This first coat of 
	polyurethane was put on this morning with a paint brush. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	Argghh! While removing the feet from the string. One dropped to the floor and rolled 
	under the router table platform. I attempted to grab it with a bar clamp, but it 
	rolled into the sump. Moved everything out of the way to get to the sump. Did a bit 
	of vacuuming while there. I could not find it in the sump. Even though we have had 
	no rain for over a month there was 3" in the bottom of the sump. Time to make a new 
	one.
</p>

<p>
	A new foot was made per the above process. It is 1.02" long. It was polished, cleaned 
	and rinsed with isopropanol. It was painted with two coats of the P-C varnish. After 
	a few days to let the varnish completely dry assembly was attempted. A number of 
	issues were immediately apparent. The two wooden columns need one end on each 
	stained and varnished. as the top is through holes. The wheels were put on the shaft 
	first and then the top was screwed in place. No attempt was made to properly align 
	the wheels. The central shaft could not be put in place as there is no central hole 
	through the wooden top! The smallest ring was dropped in first. The feet could not 
	be screwed on. Of course the smallest ring has the longest feet! Finally the largest 
	ring also could not be put in place as even with the shortest feet and pulling the 
	shaft away from the support the foot would not turn 360&deg;. The aluminum supports 
	do not have mating holes in the bottom, so are not attached. Two pictures below 
	show the partially assembled water droplet. The rings move reasonably well when 
	turning the handle. A few have a tendency to catch on their neighbor.
</p>

<p>
	A number of things have been completed. The ends of the wooden supports were stained 
	and varnished. The screw holes in the wooden top were opened to 1/8". The aluminum 
	supports were too constrained and this pinched the shaft. The assembly was put 
	together without the rings and cams. The bottoms of the aluminum supports were marked 
	for drilling with a small wood screw. The holes were drilled through with a 1/8" 
	drill bit. The bottoms were opened to 3/8" with a Forstner for about 1". The screws 
	were then held in place with nuts. When the assembly was put back together the shaft 
	rotated freely. Too much tightening of the screws holding the aluminum supports in 
	place leads to pinching the shaft.
</p>

<p>
	The entire device was put together. First the aluminum supports were attached to the 
	wooden base with the wooden posts in place. The shaft was slid most of the way through 
	and the cams were put on. The shaft was then slid the rest of the way into the far
	support. The cams were adjusted to their proper positions and the set screws were 
	tightened. The ball and rings were put through the top and the feet were screwed in 
	place. One of the larger rings' shaft was stripped. A tiny piece of napkin was 
	sufficient to hold the food tight. The top was then screwed to the aluminum supports.
</p>

<video src="watDrop/WD first motion.MOV" controls width="45%" height="45%"></video>

<p> 
	The short movie above shows the smooth action and some of the remaining challenges. 
	The smallest ring when it reaches the top of its travel does not drop back down. 
	Some of the rings catch on each other limiting travel. This latter issue is probably 
	because there is too much play in the shafts as the constraining holes are 1/8" in 
	diameter. Not seen in this movie is a tendency for the drop to go crooked and catch 
	on the smallest ring. But it is working and it looks pretty cool.
</p>

<p>
	Since the posts easily get out of alignment and then the rings catch against each 
	other, an intermediate alignment aid needs to be installed. A number of ideas were 
	considered, but I settled on an oval between the rings and the top. This oval will 
	be carved into waves and held 3/8" above the top by small brass posts. A 
	2&nbsp;3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;6&nbsp;1/4" block of oak was prepared. The brass insert 
	was aligned with the block and one hole was marked and drilled through for 4-40 
	screws (9/16"). The plate was screwed on, aligned and a second hole was marked and 
	drilled. After reattaching the insert with two screws the remaining two holes were 
	marked and drilled. The block was marked at one end to show insert orientation. The 
	insert was attached. 
</p>

<p>
	The block of wood with attached insert was clamped to the mill table with two strap 
	clamps. It was held up off the table with a 6" block of 1&nbsp;1/2" poplar. The front 
	end of the block was aligned with the front edge of the table. The center hole in 
	the insert was aligned with the spindle using a 1/8" split point drill bit. A hole 
	was drilled through the wooden block. The table was moved to the next hole, aligned 
	on both axes and drilled through. This was repeated for all of the holes in the 
	insert. The holes were cleaned up with a chamfer bit.
</p>

	The waves were carved into the block with a carving gouge. Four waves were marked 
	on the top of the block. The block was clamped in the Sjoberg vise. A #7 gouge was 
	used to carve the wave troughs. The waves and the top of the block were sanded up to 
	220 grit paper. The photo below shows the wave block at this stage.

	The corners were marked with the aid of a French arc drafting template. The block's 
	corners were then sanded to the line on the disk sander. The entire block was sanded 
	again with 220 grit paper. A coat of Kilz primer was painted on the top and sides. 
	Two coats of cobalt blue acrylic paint were painted on. The finish is very dull 
	almost chalky. The block was set on top of the top and the rings were installed. A 
	few rings were tight fits. So the wave block was cut in half, reducing the thickness 
	to 3/8". Masking tape was put around the edge and the table saw was used to cut 
	almost through in two cuts. The remainder was cut by hand. The back was planed and 
	then sanded smooth.

	Two rings were still tight. The holes for these legs were opened up to 0.140". Now 
	they move smoothly. It was noted that many of the rings fit better against their 
	neighbors in one of the two possible arrangements. All of the rings were marked with 
	a blue dot. Aligning these blue dots should minimize ring ring contact. A third coat 
	of blue paint was applied to the wave block.

	The feet for the wave block were made from a 1&nbsp;3/4" length of 3/8" brass round. 
	It was chucked in the lathe and faced. It was center drilled, drilled 3/8" deep with 
	a #43 drill, and tapped 4-40. The end was chamfered and the part was sanded with 
	400-, 600-, and 1500-grit paper. The part was parted off and the new end chamfered 
	when the parting was about half complete. The hole in the new side was deburred and 
	the tap was run through again to complete the threading. This was repeated for the 
	remaining three parts. The photo below shows the four completed supports for the 
	wave block.

	The wave block was painted blue a third time as there were some scrapes from the 
	various manipulations. It was then given two coats of satin polyurethane varnish. It 
	is pictured below.

	After putting it together and taking it apart and putting it back together, I decided 
	that the original brass insert needs its holes opened up. The screws coming from 
	above the wave block and the screws coming from below the supports will both end in 
	the wave block feet.
