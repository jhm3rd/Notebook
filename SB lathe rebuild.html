<p class=first>
	The 1954 South Bend 9” lathe was purchased for $1200 from a home machinist in 
	Noblesville. He delivered the lathe on the cabinet with a trailer on his truck. 
	He also brought a pallet jack to move the whole setup from trailer to garage. We 
	were lucky and it never tipped over. We had to set it on two 2 X 4’s to get it off 
	of the pallet jack. It came with a new 1.5 hp motor (110/220 V) installed, but 
	included the original motor. There were very few attachments: a faceplate and an 
	odd set of collets. The only clearly broken part was a handle on the gearbox. A 
	metal drawer was missing from the cabinet. The main reason I purchased it was that 
	the ways were in very good shape. The cross slide holding the cutting tool moves 
	along the ways and any problem with them impacts the accuracy of the cut. There 
	seemed to be very little wear and the original scraping was still visible in some 
	places. It was clearly dirty and the paint was peeling (three layers as I discovered 
	later.) I purchased a book detailing SB 9 and 10 restoration. The book also 
	came with a set of the necessary felt plugs that help to distribute the lubricating 
	oil. The plan was complete disassembly, thorough cleaning, part repair or 
	replacement, and reassembly. 
</p>

<p>
	The photo below shows the lathe as delivered. The collet holder (black rubber ring) 
	is attached to the lathe spindle on the left. Zooming in will show hints of the dirt 
	embedded everywhere.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 1.jpg" alt="Newly purchased lathe" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	Disassembly began with removal of the tailstock resting on the right end of the 
	lathe bed or ways. The tailstock has a round handle on the right end. In the picture 
	below you can make out the serial number that allowed me to determine the year the 
	lathe was manufactured. Just above and to the left of the serial number you can make 
	out some swirly marks on the flat part of the ways. These are scraping marks made by 
	the factory worker who “scraped the ways” by hand to make them extremely flat (less 
	than 0.001” of deviation).
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 2.jpg" alt="Tailstock end" width="2448" height="3264">

<p>
	The carriage was removed next. In the top photo it is the part with the round handle 
	on the front. A new drawer was made at this time as shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 3.jpg" alt="New drawer" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	The carriage has a taper attachment seen in the photo below. This accessory was 
	included in the purchase. It was removed at the same time as the carriage. Zooming 
	in on the rail the taper attachment slides on you can start to get a feel for the 
	crud that infested every nook and cranny of the lathe. It is a previously unknown, 
	hard and brittle substance composed of 50 year-old grease and metal chips.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 4.jpg" alt="Taper attachment" width="2448" height="3264">

<p>
	Headstock removal was next. The gear covers have been removed from the headstock in 
	the following photo. The collet chuck and the box holding the collets are in the 
	drawer below the headstock Notice how clean these gears and pulleys are. They were 
	replaced by the previous owner. I do not know why he only replaced the pulley/gear 
	set and did not clean up anything else on the headstock.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 5.jpg" alt="Headstock" width="2448" height="3264">

<p>
	Below are the change gears attached to the left side of the headstock. They would 
	have been removed to replace the gear set mentioned above. They were put back in 
	place dirty! In any event they were removed before headstock disassembly. These gears 
	link the rotation of the spindle (holding the workpiece) to the left-right movement 
	of the carriage or cross-slide.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 6.jpg" alt="Change gears" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	Disassembling these change gears was next. The handle in the upper center of the 
	picture links, unlinks or reverses the spindle carriage connection. It is shown in 
	all of its crud encrusted glory below. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 7.jpg" alt="Reversing gear" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	Removing the gear box was tackled next. It sits just below the headstock on the front 
	of the lathe. You can see it to the right of the change gears with the brass plate 
	and the two levers. (Two pictures above) One of the levers was broken. It looked 
	as if something very heavy was dropped on it, though the break cannot be seen in the photo. 
	As you can see the gearbox is full of cruft. It amazes me that the 
	gears were still in good shape and now work fine. Maybe after the handle was damaged 
	the gear box was never used again. The gear box was completely disassembled and the 
	gears kept together in groups by linking them with wire. Disassembly means removing 
	the various tapered pins and "keys" holding the metal parts together. The pins were 
	removed with pin punches. Both the pins and the keys were usually frozen in place 
	and required significant effort to remove without damaging the parts.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 8.jpg" alt="Gear box" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	The spindle needed to be removed next. The spindle is a tube that runs through the 
	headstock. It sits in needle bearings in the headstock. This is one of the most 
	important parts of the lathe. Recommendations on the web indicated the best way to 
	force it out of the bearings was to use a threaded rod. I used a wood block on each 
	end as well as a piece of pipe on the right end. The pipe was big enough to fit over the 
	nose of the spindle and rest against the headstock proper. The spindle should be 
	forced out to the right as the nuts are tightened. You can see in this picture what 
	really happened. The threaded rod started to bend. I could not budge the spindle 
	this way. I next tried a wooden block on the left end of the spindle and a large 
	hammer. Still no luck so I called the original owner as he had removed the spindle 
	previously to replace the gear/pulley set. He came over and being about twice my 
	size was able to knock it loose with a hammer. A really nice guy!
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 9.jpg" alt="Spindle removal" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	The motor and its mounting support were next. These were relatively straightforward 
	compared to the previous parts, just heavy and bulky. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 10.jpg" alt="Motor and support" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	The bed and feet were the last parts removed. They were easy to separate, one bolt 
	in each case. I was able to move the bed by hand to the back of the bench. The feet 
	were secured to the 1/2" thick steel bench top by four bolts each. The bed was 
	lowered to the floor for clean up and painting via a set of pulleys suspended from 
	hooks (previously used to hold bikes) in the ceiling. These are shown later in a 
	reassembly photo.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 11.jpg" alt="Bed and feet" width="3264" height="2448">

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 12.jpg" alt="Tailstock disassembly" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	Pictured above is complete disassembly of the tailstock as an example. The 
	round handle was also removed from the shaft and bearing. Paint stripping and cruft 
	removal were next. I used a a degreaser known as "purple" (ZEP Industrial Purple 
	Degreaser) as it is purple and a separate orange paint stripper (Citri-Strip). I 
	purchased a large plastic tub and diluted the purple with distilled water and placed 
	the parts in it to soak overnight. Only a few parts were cleaned at a time. This is 
	due to flash rust. It was summertime when I got to the cleaning so I had to consider 
	humidity. After paint removal the parts were soaked and various brushes from steel 
	to tooth brush were used to reveal bare metal. The purple solution was rinsed off 
	with water and the parts were then rinsed with acetone. This gets rid of the water, 
	but it evaporates so quickly that it cools the part and if you are not careful water 
	condenses on it causing almost immediate rusting. I then put a light coat of oil on 
	the part for storage prior to assembly. My fingernails were black throughout most of 
	the cleaning months.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 13.jpg" alt="Parts" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	Above is a shot of the cleaning process in progress. The cleaned parts are bagged 
	on the left. There is also some progress cleaning the bench. It is easy to notice 
	the difference between the bagged parts and the dirty parts on the right.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 14.jpg" alt="Clean parts" width="2448" height="3264">

<p>
	The parts have all been cleaned and the bench is as well. Now it is time for painting 
	and assembly. I went to a paint dealer for the paint. This was a mistake, I should 
	have just followed instructions from the internet. I purchased a primer and a finish 
	coat. They only had the offwhite color for the finish coat. I would have preferred 
	something darker to hide the eventual dirt. The real problem was the primer. It was 
	so thick and dried so fast that it would dry in one section before the adjacent 
	section was painted so joining the two left a very bumpy finish. I probably should 
	have thinned it in retrospect. Except for the cabinet only the unfinished cast 
	surfaces were painted. So some parts had significant painting (gear covers), while 
	others had minimal or no painting (e.g., gears).
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 15.jpg" alt="Lifting the bed" width="2448" height="3264">

<p>
	The picture above shows the pulley system used to raise the bed up and onto the feet. 
	The bench and bed/feet have been primed and have the finish coat of paint. It is 
	difficult to see, but the bench has been leveled with wooden pads under the legs. It 
	is very important for a lathe to be properly leveled. Otherwise the bed will twist 
	slightly (a few thousandths of an inch) and the lathe will then always cut a slight 
	taper. Once the bed was attached to the feet they were shimmed to make sure the bed 
	was as level as possible. I used an app on the phone as a level (accurate to the 
	nearest 0.1&deg;). 
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 16.jpg" alt="Assembling the carriage" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	Here is the carriage in the midst of assembly. You can see some flash rust in the 
	lower right. The bumpiness of the painted surface was not due to the primer here. 
	The majority of the parts including the carriage housing were made from cast iron. 
	The iron was cast in a sand mold. Only surfaces that mated with other metal surfaces 
	were machined, so the outside painted surface is slightly bumpy. At about 10 o'clock 
	on the top gear you can see one of the white felt pads that were put in various 
	holes in the castings. They help to transfer oil from the oiling points There are 
	about 15 places to add oil across the entire lathe in addition to lubricating the 
	ways.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 17.jpg" alt="New shifter" width="2448" height="3264">

<p>
	A new handle had to be purchased for the gearbox. There was also another gear that 
	had to be purchased. Luckily, there is a pretty active community of South Bend lathe
	owners and parts can be found. The handle was cleaned up and painted as shown.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 18.jpg" alt="Cross slide screw" width="2448" height="3264">

<p>
	The cross slide screw (moves the cutting tool toward and away from the workpiece) 
	needed to be taken apart for cleaning. As you can see the screwdriver slot is 
	bifurcated. You can buy the special tool needed to remove it, but I decided to make 
	one instead. I made it from a low carbon steel rod and put a hexagon cross section 
	on the end to hold it in a handle for inserts. The low carbon steel allowed me to 
	harden the tool by heating it to "cherry red" with a propane torch and quenching it 
	in motor oil. It worked like a champ and saved me $45.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 19.jpg" alt="Clean cross slide screw" width="2448" height="3264">

<p>
	The most complex repair was on the smaller of the two cross slide screws seen below. 
	The threads on the end were damaged beyond repair (hard to see this in the picture). 
	It was repaired by removing the end of the shaft and making a replacement. The old 
	screw end was drilled and tapped for 1/4-20 threads to match the new part. A SketchUp 
	plan for this part is also shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 28.jpg" alt="Damaged cross slide screw" width="3264" height="2448">

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 29.jpg" alt="Screw repair plan" width="984" height="1232">

<p>
	The image below shows the "screw" method of putting the spindle back into the 
	headstock. It worked this time!!! The purchased serpentine belt (these are difficult 
	to find by length) is already installed along with the motor mount in back. The 
	lead screw (long screw that stretches across the face of the lathe and drives the 
	carriage, if desired) is also installed along with the assembled gearbox.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 20.jpg" alt="Installing the spindle" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	Below is a shot of the lathe after assembling and installing the carriage, cross 
	slide and the tailstock. The book used for this rebuild is below the carriage. If 
	you look carefully you can see the felt strips in a plastic bag to the right of the 
	book. These were snaked through holes in the walls of the headstock, gearbox and 
	carriage. In this picture you can also see the aluminum knob on the new drawer on 
	the right. This was made on the small lathe in the basement and is similar to the 
	original steel knob on the left.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 21.jpg" alt="Mostly assembled lathe" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	The slightly out-of-focus picture below shows the change gears and gear covers 
	installed on the headstock. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 22.jpg" alt="Gears and covers" width="2448" height="3264">

<p>
	The next challenge was a fairly simple repair job. The picture below shows the 
	toolpost and the broken washer that holds it in a tee slot in the cross slide 
	(easily seen in the second picture). A replacement was made from steel plate. The 
	toolpost works by screwing a bolt through the top of the post down to a tool fitting 
	through the slot in the post. The tool pushes down on the cross slide and pulls the 
	washer up against the top of the tee slot. Cranking down really hard on the bolt must 
	have broken the original washer and subsequent tightening only served to twist the 
	washer out of shape. The extra washer in the second picture sits on top of the cross 
	slide, under the tool, and serves to raise the tool tip to the center height of the 
	spindle.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 23.jpg" alt="New toolpost washer" width="2448" height="3264">

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 24.jpg" alt="Toolpost in place" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	Here you can see the motor and the inverter have been installed. I decided to use 
	the original motor as the newer motor used too many amps for the 15 amp breaker in 
	the garage. The new motor could be wired for 110 volts, whereas the old required 
	220 volts and three phase current. Consequently, I had to purchase the inverter. 
	It will not work on a GFCI circuit so I had to run a new outlet from the ceiling 
	lights.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 25.jpg" alt="Motor and inverter" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	The last shot of the lathe below also shows one of the new chucks purchased. It is 
	a 3-jaw chuck and was purchased along with a 4-jaw chuck. The three jaws of the 
	former all move in concert, while the jaws on the 4-jaw chuck are independent. So 
	the 4-jaw chuck is used for square, rectangular or odd shaped parts. It is also 
	used when you need to get the part concentric with the spindle to 0.001" or less. 
	The 3-jaw chuck will only give concentricity with the spindle to 0.002-3". They 
	cost about $150 each and weigh 40 lbs. The board underneath the ways is placed 
	on top of the ways to protect them when the chucks are put on or taken off the 
	threaded spindle.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 26.jpg" alt="Completed lathe" width="3264" height="2448">

<p>
	One final shot is of a wrench I made from 1/4" thick steel plate. Here it is shown 
	on the square headed bolt in the cross slide toolpost. The hex end is used to tighten 
	and loosen the tailstock. Both of these operations happen frequently. The wrench is 
	routinely kept on the tailstock nut so it is always handy. (This nut can be seen in 
	the picture above in the middle of the tailstock.) The square and hex holes 
	were made by drilling round holes, which were circumscribed by the square or hexagon. 
	The corners were then filed to scribed lines with a 3-corner file.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/SB rebuild 27.jpg" alt="New toolpost washer" width="2448" height="3264">

<p>
	While working on some changes to tool location (8/29/19) I needed to move the belt 
	covers. I decided to put the cover on the motor pulley belt. But before I did this 
	I needed to finally deal with the belt slipping issue. The spindle was not correctly 
	aligned with the motor pulley system, so the belt would slip off of the spindle 
	pulleys to the left. I also noticed at this time that the lever tightening the belt 
	needed adjustment for tightening different pulley combinations. Fixing this required 
	two different adjustments. The two bolts holding the motor mount in place were 
	loosened with a 7/32" hex wrench. Using a long straight-edge the two sets of pulleys 
	were aligned left to right to fix most of the slippage. This was done by aligning 
	the straight-edge against a spindle pulley and shifting the motor mount left or 
	right as needed with a hammer and a board. The next task was making sure the pulley 
	shaft was parallel with the spindle to minimize adjustments when flipping the belt 
	tension lever. Aligning the straight-edge with the side of a pulley in the back 
	showed how much the motor mount needed to spin around the right bolt. A little bit 
	of pulling on one end and the pulleys were aligned. Rechecking the first alignment 
	showed little movement so the two screws holding the motor mount in place were 
	tightened. The belt no longer slips on any of the three pulley settings!
</p>

<p>
	After some consideration I realized the bracket was designed to fit within the 
	belt cover and bolt at its middle to the motor mount. I had some screws from the 
	rebuild to attach the cover to the bracket with the help of some washers. The 
	bracket's screw holes were a little corroded so some oil was put on the screws. 
	The bracket was then bolted to the motor mount. Only one screw is used on the 
	motor mount, but the attachment seemed sufficiently solid such that the cover 
	did not rotate into the pulley.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbLatheR/Belt cover.jpg" alt="Belt cover installed" width="1894" height="2847">

<p class="note">
	An attempt was also made to install the other belt cover. A flange is built into 
	this belt cover with two screw holes. They do not align with the two screw holes 
	seen in the bracket photo above!! It is possible that only one screw is needed, 
	but another issue arose. When put in place over the rear pulleys the cover does 
	not fit properly over the spindle pulleys! It seems for this to fit the SB covers 
	over the left and right sides of the spindle need to be removed. The entire setup 
	seemed quite contrived. Since this is not an OSHA compliant shop I decided to forgo 
	installing this belt cover.
