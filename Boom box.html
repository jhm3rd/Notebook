<p class=first>
	Ryan and Rhea have decided she needs a new boom box to play her Israeli folk dance 
	music while teaching. Her old boom box no longer works with her phone. I looked online 
	for box ideas and found one design that seemed unique and doable. Unfortunately, it 
	only accommodates two speakers and Ryan has determined that four are needed. He is in 
	charge of the electronics. I will build the box.
</p>

<p>
	The design spotted on the web is essentially a rectangular box with two speakers 
	adjacent in front. Its uniqueness is the rounded ends of the box. It is made from 
	sheets of plywood all cut from the same template. The sheets are layered together 
	to make the box. Certainly seems doable, though routing with a template will be new 
	for me. The challenge is where to put the additional two speakers. I don't think 
	two can be added to the top unless the top is raised well above the front mounted 
	speakers. An alternative that struck my fancy is an angled top tilting up from front 
	to back. This would provide the needed room and not throw off the look of the front 
	face. The challenge is construction. Each layer from front to back would need to 
	raise the top relative to the previous layer. So each layer requires a new 
	template. Once glued up the top would have a series of ridges. These would need to 
	be removed in some fashion. Two attempted sketches are below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bmb/BMB round idea.JPG" alt="The rounded rectangle idea" width="1374" height="2138">

<p>
	The second idea that occurred to me at 3 am was a dodecahedron half, a hemi-dodecahedron. 
	This shape would have five full pentagonal faces. One facing forward and pointed a 
	little toward the ground with a flat side on the bottom parallel to the ground (face 
	F in the sketch below). Four pentagonal faces would flank this face, two above the 
	forward facing pentagon and two to the sides. These four faces would hold the 
	speakers. The front face could be decorated or hold any switches. The back would be 
	flat and connected to the five faces by sliced off pentagonal faces. A rough sketch 
	is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bmb/BMB dodec idea.JPG" alt="The hemi-dodecahedron idea" width="1256" height="1740">

<p>
	The bolt circle diameter on the chosen speakers is 5". The speaker extends beyond 
	the bolt circle, so the minimum size to consider is ~6". This must fit within the 
	four pentagons. To find the largest square that will fit within a given pentagon, 
	the inradius, r, is used. If t is the length of a side then r = 0.6882 X t. The 
	diagonal of the square is 2r = 1.3764 X t. The length of the side of a square is 
	s = r&radic;2. Consequently, t = s / (&radic;2 X 0.6882). The side of the smallest 
	pentagon that contains a 6" square is 6.165". The pentagons need to be larger than 
	this (7"?), because the pentagon edges are not square, but angle in producing a 
	smaller pentagon. The hemi-dodecahedron would stand almost a foot tall.
</p>

<p>
	Ryan said that a 3" or 3.5" speaker would also work. The 3" speaker has a bolt 
	circle of 3.75". This leads to a 4.75" square for the speaker. The corresponding 
	containing pentagon is 4.88", so maybe a 5&nbsp;1/2" pentagon might work. This would 
	yield a more acceptable size for the overall box and keep the weight down.
</p>

<p>
	Ryan had a number of legitimate concerns about the hemi-dodecahedron. He suggested 
	a rectangle with the front and three sides replaced with four angled panels forming 
	a pentagon: flat bottom and top. The four speakers would all be arrayed to point 
	mostly forward. He also suggested a 3.5" speaker, whose bolt circle is 93 mm, 3.66". 
	I like the idea for its simplicity. I made more detailed drawings and found a 
	problem with the design. The 4" sides do not leave sufficient room for the extensions 
	of the speakers behind the panels. The side and front speakers bump, if not overlap. 
	Longer panels will be needed, 4&nbsp;1/2" to 5" should be sufficient.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bmb/BMB hept idea.jpg" alt="The heptahedron idea" width="1931" height="2768">

<p>
	Ryan provided specs on a <a href="https://www.parts-express.com/Dayton-Audio-DMA90-8-3-1-2-Dual-Magnet-Aluminum-Cone-Full-Range-Driver-8-Ohm-295-589">new 3&nbsp;1/2" speaker</a>. 
	There is no longer a problem with 
	speakers bumping into one another. One problem remains and that is the corner 
	clearance. In the back corners the speakers run right into the back wall. Moving to 
	4&nbsp;1/2" or 5" is a necessity for these speakers. The photo below shows the plan 
	with 5" sides and 5" height minus the top and bottom, which will be set in with 
	rabbets. Menards sells red oak, poplar and aspen in 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;8" 
	(7/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;7&nbsp;1/4"). Approximately 60" is required.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bmb/BMB hept 5.jpg" alt="The heptahedron plan with 5 inch sides" width="1542" height="1498">

<p class="note">
	The current plan is to glue all of the joints and reinforce the side joints with 
	inserts as shown above. An outstanding question is whether access to the box interior 
	is required. If so, either the top or back could be attached by screwing instead of 
	gluing.
</p>

<p>
	With most of the questions resolved the wood, 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;5&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;4' 
	poplar(X2), was purchased at Menards. The angles on the drawing above were carefully 
	measured, realizing that the total of the angles should be 540&deg;. The back two 
	angles are 82&deg;. The outside corners on the front are both 108&deg; and the central 
	angle on the front is 160&deg;. The table saw blade will be set to 54&deg; and 80&deg; 
	for the front three angles, respectively and 82&deg; for the back corners.
</p>

<p>
	The plan of cutting is as follows: first, two ends of the wood will be cut at 82&deg;. 
	Secondly, these pieces will be cut off with 54&deg; angles. Third, a second set of 
	54&deg; angles will be cut on these new ends. Fourth, these two faces will be cut off 
	at 80&deg;. When the blade is at 82&deg; two reinforcing strips will be cut. Similarly, 
	two reinforcing strips will be cut with the blade at 54&deg; and one when the blade 
	is at 80&deg;. The top and the bottom will be cut and after cutting to shape will be 
	attached with screws and glue. The back will extend above and below the sides. It 
	needs to be wider than the nominal 5&nbsp;1/2", so will be made of two pieces. It 
	will be attached only with screws. (Reinforcing the back joints may not be necessary.) 
	Of course, before putting the box together the speaker holes need to be cut out.
</p>

<p>
	The two front pieces are 5&nbsp;1/8" long and the two side pieces are 4&nbsp;1/2" 
	long. All of the sides were cut as described above. The top and bottom were cut to 
	11&nbsp;1/2" long. Then the angles were cut using the miter. The miter was set by 
	matching lines drawn on the top and bottom to a line drawn on the table from the 
	blade. The only thing not done was making the final reinforcing strip for the front 
	angle. I am not sure how to make this piece. The first photo shows the pieces 
	arranged to check the angles. The second photo shows the top and bottom cut to fit 
	the angles produced by the sides.
</p>

<p>
	The electronics were ordered and arrived. The stated hole size for the speakers is 
	83.5 mm. A hole cutter was set to 1.64" with a caliper. The large drill press was 
	used as it is now slower than the smaller. The four faces were marked and punched 
	for the center holes. A fence was clamped to the table. The piece was held tight to 
	the fence, but it was not the sturdiest fence. The hole cutting well nevertheless. 
	The four holes and the hole cutter are shown below. The holes were not completed as 
	the cutter was set for cutting wheels. It doesn't matter as the speakers are a good 
	fit. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="bmb/BMB holes.jpg" alt="The holes cut in the box faces." width="2162" height="1746">

<p>
	Holes were marked from the speaker to the faces. These were drilled for #6&nbsp;X&nbsp;5/8" 
	wood screws. The holes were counter sunk. After playing with the faces and the bottom 
	of the box a plan was devised for gluing the top, bottom, and four faces together. 
	One face's location on the bottom was marked. It was glued, clamped with a pinch 
	screw and screwed in place with two #6&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/4" drywall screws. The 
	remaining three faces were similarly glued and screwed. Pinch clamps were also used 
	between the faces. The photo shows the clamped faces. Glue was spread on the tops 
	of face edges and the top was put on again with two screws per face.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bmb/BMB faces glued.jpg" alt="The box faces glued and screwed to the bottom." width="2020" height="1457">

<p>
	The clamps were removed. The photo below shows the box at this stage. All of the gaps 
	were filled with wood putty. The screw heads were also covered with wood putty. After 
	drying the all external surfaces were sanded on the belt sander. This produced the 
	box in its final shape. It was then sanded by hand with 220 grit paper. The second 
	photo below shows the sanded box.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bmb/BMB box sanded.jpg" alt="The box sanded on all sides except the back." width="2165" height="1792">

<p>
	Marked and drilled the top for a 3" long handle. A short or right angle screwdriver 
	is needed to attach the handle. A short screwdriver was located and the handle 
	attached as seen below. The back did not fit as one box side was not square. A corner 
	of the box was sanded on the belt sander removing about 1/8" of material. The back now 
	fits well. It was drilled for four screws with mating holes in the top and bottom of 
	the box.
</p>

<p>
	Ryan assembled most of the electronics last evening. The back does not sit flat on 
	the box. One side seems square, but the other side is not. One corner of the box 
	needs to be sanded. The location of the L-bracket on the bottom of the box was 
	determined. A rectangular board with the USB input, lights, and Aux input was  
	located on the back. It will be mounted on the inside of the back with the three 
	rectangular connectors sticking through. In addition the power in connector for 
	charging the batteries was located. The power in connector is a round connector. It 
	is 0.345" in diameter with a 1/8" deep countersink, 0.428". The three connector 
	dimensions are: USB-9/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;5/8", Aux-9/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;9/16", and 
	lights-1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;11/16". The photo shows the planned location for the L-bracket 
	with batteries and amp, as well as the location of the connector board and the bagged 
	power inlet.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bmb/BMB elec locs.jpg" alt="Mapping out the locations of the electronic parts." width="1781" height="1688">

<p>
	The location of the connector board was carefully mapped out and the locations of 
	each connector was measured and marked. The drill press was used to drill a 1/2" hole 
	in each of the connector locations. A 9/16" drill would have been better for two of 
	the connectors, but none was to be found. The holes were then squared with a 1/2" 
	chisel. The 3/16" block between two connectors came loose and was removed. Even 
	worse was a 2" long tearout on the lights connector. It had to be glued back in place 
	as seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bmb/BMB tearout.jpg" alt="Clamping the tearout from chiseling a hole square." width="1753" height="1588">

<p>
	The box sans back was painted the same blue as the Adirondack chairs. The back will 
	be painted when all holes fit connectors. The hole for the power connector was 
	drilled. It was drilled first with an S drill and then countersunk 1/8" with a 27/64" 
	drill. The connector was a perfect tight fit.
</p>

<img class=inline src="bmb/BMB box painted.jpg" alt="The box after one coat of the blue paint." width="1999" height="1755">

<p>
	The rectangular holes were enlarged as needed with a rasp and sandpaper. When the 
	connectors fit the outside face and edges of the back were sanded to 220 grit. The 
	back was then painted. The box is now rough as the water based paint raised the grain. 
	I plan to sand and repaint after this first coat has completely dried (6 hrs). This 
	was done and the box now looks and feels great. Time to assemble when my course on 
	resawn veneered boxes is over.
</p>

<p>
	Two screw holes were marked on the bottom for the L-bracket that holds the battery 
	and amplifier. They were drilled with the right angle drilling adapter using a 1/16" 
	drill bit. (The drill had to be almost completely buried in the chuck for the adapter 
	to fit. The 3/8" sticking out was perfect.) The bracket was screwed in place using two 
	#4&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2" wood screws. The input/output board was also screwed to the 
	back with two of the same screws. The charging adapter was pushed into its socket. 
	(It probably needs to be glued in place.) The three photos below show the completed 
	box. 
</p>

<p>
	Later in the afternoon Ryan completed the electronics and Rhea hooked her phone up 
	by blue tooth and was thrilled with the result.
