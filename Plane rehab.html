<p class=first>
	I just finished a course on tuning and using handplanes at Marc Adams School of 
	Woodworking. It was taught by Stephen Proctor. One of the keys to a good hand plane 
	is how well the frog (holds the blade) mates with the plane body. Doug Pearson gave 
	me a plane he had purchased and never used. It is a Craftsman plane. Where the body
	and the frog meet was painted on both parts. These surfaces need to be ground in place. 
	Consequently, I did not use this plane during the course. The photo below shows the 
	painted mating surface of the frog.
</p>

<img class=inline src="plnRhb/PR painted frog.jpg" alt="Painted mating surface" width="1419" height="1502">

<p>
	I decided to repair this issue and see if I can get this plane to function well. The 
	rest of the plane is in great shape. The big problem with the mating parts was that 
	the frog sat so high the two front feet did not touch. In fact they were 0.076" too 
	high. This was determined by slipping a series of small drills under the feet. 
</p>

<p>
	The body of the plane was clamped in the mill. It sat on two vee blocks and was 
	clamped with 3" C-clamps. The first pass was made with a 3/8" end mill. This was 
	extremely noisy due to the chatter. The finish was also not very good. The two 
	photos below show the clamped part and the first pass.
</p>

<img class=inline src="plnRhb/PR first pass.jpg" alt="After the first pass with a 3/8 end mill" width="1832" height="1498">

<p>
	The 3/8" end mill was swapped for the two flute insert cutter. This gave a much better 
	finish with little chatter. A total of 0.075" was removed in 0.005" passes. The area 
	where the feet of the frog rest was also milled using a 5/16" end mill. Only about 
	0.002" was removed. This removed the paint and leveled the "foot rests".The 
	finished milling is shown below. At this point the frog rests nicely on all areas 
	with little wobble. !
</p>

<p class="note">
	The raised surface built into the body to support the frog was completely removed as 
	can be seen comparing the two photos
</p>

<p>
	The next steps are first, removing the paint from the frog bottom with paint remover. 
	Second, is grinding the two parts in place with valve grinding compound. This latter 
	was ordered from Amazon.
</p>

<p>
	A week or two after the grinding compound arrived it was put to use. The Scotch 
	wheel was used to remove most of the paint in the affected areas of the frog. A few 
	small dabs of valve grinding compound were applied and fifteen minutes was spent 
	rubbing the two parts back and forth against one another. The first photo shows the 
	grinding in progress. The second shows the finish when 'complete'. It is not a shiny 
	finish, but is smooth to the touch. Acetone was used to remove the post grinding 
	mess.

<p>
	A similar process and amount of time was spent grinding the smallest of the three 
	usable planes. Its grinding is shown below.

	The final shot from today shows the paper-thin chips made with the completed Stanley 
	plane from Doug. The blade for this plane is very well ground. The blades for the 
	other two planes are in pretty bad shape and are next on the list for rehab.

<p>
	Continued working on the planes this morning. The old Stanley No. 5 had the frog and 
	body ground. This was started at class, but not finished. After fifteen minutes the 
	surfaces looked flat and all milling marks were gone. The rest of the parts had 
	rust removed with the 3M wheel. Parts were oiled and reassembled to give the finished 
	product shown below.

<p>
	Finished up the third plane this afternoon. There is an extra blade. It was first 
	sharpened on the grinding wheels. Then it was sharpened on the stone. The back was 
	flattened on the stone as well. This blade fits in the two larger planes, so will 
	be used in those as needed. The smaller blade was also sharpened on the wheel giving 
	it a good curve. Then it was sharpened on the sonte with a lot of cutting fluid. 
	Again the back was flattened on the stone. This blade is pretty aggressive and gives 
	good chips. It is shown in the plane mouth in the photo below.
