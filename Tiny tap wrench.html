<p class=first>
	I was seeking a quick project to complete prior to a vacation in Puerto Vallarta. 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpp6lgdc_XO_FZYJppaFa5w">Joe Pieczynski</a> 
	was tapping a hole 0-80 and used a tiny tap wrench that I liked and so, made a copy.
</p>

<img class=inline src="tTapWr/Tiny tap wrench - JP.png" alt="Joe's tiny tap wrench'" width="1892" height="1370">

<p>
	A 1.25" length of 1.25" aluminum round stock was found in the scrap bin. One end was 
	faced. The diameter was then reduced to 1.194" for a length of 0.60". This diameter 
	was selected as it gave a nice multiple of the circumference (3.75") to the 25 pitch 
	of the knurling tools. The outside corner was chamfered with a file. The cutoff tool 
	was used to make a groove 0.50" from the end of the bar to a depth of about 0.05". A 
	slight chamfer was made at the groove with a three-corner file.
</p>

<p>
	The knurling tool was put in place, opened as wide as possible, and placed over the 
	workpiece. It was about half on and half off the work. The lathe was started at a 
	slow speed and the tool was tightened. A significant amount of WD-40 was used as a 
	lubricant. The knurl looked good so the tool was advanced to the groove. The tool 
	was backed off the workpiece. The knurl looked very professional! 
</p>

<p>
	After measuring a 0-80 tap a 0.140" drill was used to drill a hole about 0.60" deep. 
	This hole was countersunk. The work was then moved to the mill. It was set in a Vee 
	block. The Vee block clamp could not be used as it was too close to the end where 
	the hole needed to be drilled. Consequently, the Vee block was clamped to the table 
	as was the work to the Vee block, both with strap clamps. A drill was placed 
	in the chuck and used to find center simply by centering in front of the previously 
	drilled hole. It was then moved 0.25" in from the end. Both stops were set on the 
	table. The hole was started and then drilled into the through-hole with a 0.106" 
	drill. This hole was then tapped 6-32.
</p>

<p>
	The part was returned to the lathe and the previously cut groove was used as the 
	place for parting off with a freshly sharpened parting tool. The parting tool was 
	not extended sufficiently to complete the job, so a hack saw was used to finish 
	parting the tap wrench from the stub. This left blade marks so the tap wrench was 
	put into the lathe using aluminum soft jaws. It was faced, the corner chamfered and 
	the hole was countersunk. A 3/8" long 6-32 set screw was installed in the cross-hole. 
	After a little cleanup the tiny tap wrench was complete and is shown below.
