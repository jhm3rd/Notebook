<p class=first>
	I just finished a cutting board class, really a bandsaw class, at Marc Adams taught 
	by Alex Snodgrass. Great class! One of the things Alex mentioned at the end of the 
	class was how to use some of the cutoffs. These are angled pieces, 30&deg;, made of 
	walnut, maple and cherry. They are about 20" long. These boards were cut into 4" long 
	sections. Pairs were glued up on their short sides, one cherry centered and one 
	walnut, six pairs in total. After a day of drying the long edges of two pairs were 
	glued together and clamped. This is seen in the photo below with more unglued 
	triangles behind the clamped parts.
</p>

<p>
	The three diamonds from above are then glued up into a hexagon to be sliced into 
	coasters. Not sure how best to slice them <em>sans</em> bandsaw. After the glueup 
	above the three diamond cross sectioned pieces were placed in alignment as seen in 
	the first photo. The second photo shows the three pieces with a hand clamp and 
	highlights the gap that will demand some sanding.
</p>

<p>
	The parts were sanded on the belt sander in an attempt to modify the angles slightly 
	and achieve a better fit. This was partially accomplished as seen in the first photo 
	below. Cherry veneer was selected to fill the gap. Three pieces were pushed in to 
	fill the triangular gap as shown in the second photo below. The third photo shows 
	the set of blocks glued and clamped with many clamps.

<p>
	Unfortunately, after removing the clamps the bottoms side was examined. The alignment 
	was very poor as can be seen in the photo below. A month later a second set of 
	triangular blocks was prepped. There were many walnut versions with uneven edges and 
	they were all slightly larger triangles than the remaining maple versions. These 
	were sanded on the belt sander until they were shaped very similarly to the others. 
	This time around I used fast setting CA glue from Loctite. It sets in about 15 
	seconds, so I pressed the pairs of triangles onto supports, while pinching them 
	together for 30 seconds. The six triangles made are seen in the second photo. These 
	six were then glued up in pairs with large pinch clamps.

<p class="note">
	Note the two blocks that are not mixed cherry and walnut centers, but just walnut. 
	(Sound more like chocolates than wooden blocks.) There were more of the walnut than 
	the cherry. That's life.
</p>

<p>
	The blocks were glued up like last time. This time the gap was smaller and was filled 
	with two kinds of veneer as shown in the photo below. A slight gap appeared during 
	glueup and this will need to be fixed with glue and sandpaper on each coaster.
</p>

<p>
	A decision was made to use the table saw to cut the coasters from the blanks. The 
	challenge is getting accurate cuts as two cuts are needed for each slice. A long 
	30&deg; offcut was taped to the inside corner of the crosscut sled for support. A 
	series of ten 3/8" wide blocks were cut from a piece of scrap. Another scrap board 
	was clamped to the sled to serve as a stop. The photo below shows the crosscut sled 
	setup.
</p>

<p>
	The block was a challenge to hold. About eight slices were removed from each block. 
	Some were cut better than others. All were sanded on the belt sander until the saw 
	marks were removed. There were gaps between triangles on most of the pieces. These 
	were filled with glue and sanded. The edges were sanded and all of the corners were 
	chamfered. The sawing left about 1" thick blocks. One slice was cut off by hand, but 
	this was too much trouble to repeat. The coasters were cleaned of saw dust by 
	blowing with the vacuum. This worked quite well using an attachment to constrain 
	the output. The picture below shows the coasters after soaking in mineral oil and 
	wiping off the excess. One coaster broke when dropped. A triangle popped out. With 
	luck the remainder are not quite as fragile.
