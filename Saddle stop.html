<p class=first>
	I was getting antsy working for so long on decorating the orrery, so I decided to 
	start another project. This is the MLA-8 Indicator and Saddle Stop Bracket for the 
	South Bend 9" lathe. The main bracket is a casting. It was painted first with a 
	few coats of enamel to match the lathe. The plans are clear, but the instructions 
	are minimal. A picture of the plans (though not so clear) is included below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Saddle bracket plans.jpg" alt="Saddle stop bracket plans" width="574" height="364">

<p>	
	The casting was held in the vise on the shaper and about 1/8" of material was 
	removed on one side of the boss. A picture of the part in the vise is included as 
	is a short movie of the shaper in action. 
	A series of 0.010 X 0.010" cuts was made. A finishing cut of 0.005" depth ended the 
	cutting. The part was flipped over and an attempt was made to level the previously 
	cut face. Again 1/8" of material was removed. The two faces so created were far 
	from parallel. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Saddle clamped in vise.jpg" alt="Saddle bracket clamped in vise" width="574" height="364">

<video width="100%" height="100%" controls="true">
	<source src="images/Saddle shaping.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p>
	Used the 2-insert cutter in the mill to align the faces of the boss. When finished 
	they were about 0.020" off and pretty parallel with the sides of the casting. A 
	machinist's jack was used to support the end being cut and cardboard was set 
	between both vise jaws and the part. The dial indicator was used to set the 
	alignment of the casting and paper shims were used to get it close to true.
</p>

<p>
	Again the casting was trued up with shims in the vise indicating on the newly cut 
	boss surface. The center was marked and the boss was drilled through with a 1/4" 
	drill using a lot of cutting fluid. The shaft of the indicator to be used is 
	0.374" in diameter, so this was followed by a 23/64" drill. Unfortunately, the 
	setup was on the mill and the 3/8" reamer was too long to fit between the casting 
	and the drill chuck. An adaptor was made to hold the reamer in the Sherline collet. 
	A 1 5/8" piece of 1/2" aluminum round was faced and the diameter reduced to 0.375" 
	for 5/8". A flat was filed on the reduced end with a three corner file. This end 
	that now fits the Sherline collet was held in the Sherline collet and the opposite 
	end was faced. This end of the holder was reduced just sufficiently to clean up the 
	outside of the part. A hole was center drilled and drilled to 0.277" and then bored 
	to 0.310" to fit the reamer. This same end was cross-drilled completely through on 
	the drill press 3/8" from the end and tapped 6-32. Two set screws were found to hold 
	the reamer in place. The ends and holes were all chamfered. The part with reamer 
	was still just a little too long to fit so the length of the end that fits the 
	collet was extended about 5/16". This worked well and the hole was reamed with the 
	3/8" reamer.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Reamer adapter.jpg" alt="Reamer adapter" width="1619" height="2584">

<p>
	Finally, returned to the saddle stop after almost a year. First, some measurements 
	were marked on the stop body. A 3/8" transfer punch was inserted in the hole and 
	measurements were measured relative to the point of the punch. The two holes were 
	marked out. The location of the bottom of the vee groove was marked. The distance 
	to the bottom was also marked.
</p>

<p>
	Second, the bottom was cut to the line on the shaper. The shaper would not cut at 
	the beginning. After sharpening the tool it still would not cut. I decided the cast 
	iron was too hard on the outside. I filed most of the surface off. Then the shaper 
	cut fine. Two problems were noted. First, the tool would on occasion catch on a hard 
	spot on the front side of the stop and leave a big groove in the surface. Second, 
	the leading edge of the surface was always a ramp up to the final cutting height. 
	This "ramp" is about 1/16" wide. I am not sure how to remedy either issue. During 
	the many cuts (0.010" X 0.010") the bottom pulley attached to the motor shaft kept 
	coming loose. I filed the flat on the shaft on two occasions. This may have been the 
	key to keeping it tight with the set screw. The upper pulley this pulley is belted 
	to also came loose once as did the collar behind it. In any event I eventually 
	cut through the mark on the side of the stop. I stopped at this point to take a 
	measurement. Setting the stop's machined face on the granite and measuring up to the 
	inserted punch shows an additional 1/16" needs to be removed. A photo of an early 
	stage in the cutting and one of the surface of the stop are shown below. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Shaper cutting the bottom.jpg" alt="Using the shaper to cut the stop" width="1619" height="2584">
<img class=inline src="images/Shaper cut surface.jpg" alt="The surface finish on the stop" width="1619" height="2584">

<p class="note">
	Note the multiple grooves where the cutter caught on some edge hard spot. This last 
	pass was worse than most. Note also the "ramped" edge. I will try again after 
	shortening the length of the exposed tool.
</p>

<p>
	The tool was removed from the tool holder and shortened by about 1/4" on the bench 
	grinder with water cooling. The cutting faces were briefly reground. Upon inserting 
	the tool into the holder only about 3/8" was exposed. The tool holder was also 
	pushed as far into the tool post as possible. Finally, the leading edge of the stop 
	was filed at a 45&deg; angle to remove any potential hard spots. The cutting went
	extremely well and took about one hour: five minutes per pass. There was no "ramp" 
	left on the leading edge or on the sides. No hard spots were encountered. The picture 
	below shows the result. (Note how little tool is exposed.)
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Shaper cut final.jpg" alt="The completed surface finish on the stop" width="2313" height="2237">

<p class="note">
	The surface finish is still not very smooth as can be seen in the picture. The shaper 
	has a lot of vibration. It has walked a few inches. There is a rattling noise coming 
	from inside the machine as it cuts. It sounds like it is the eccentric mechanism that 
	is making the noise and may be the source of the vibration. It will need to be taken 
	apart to determine what is loose or worn and what can be replaced or repaired.
</p>

<p>
	The next task is drilling the cross holes in the stop. The hole that clamps a shaft 
	in place is drilled 10-24 through for half of the depth and tapped the other half. 
	A 10-24 tap needs a #25 drill. This will be followed by a 7/32" clearance drill. 
	Finally, a countersink will be drilled 0.190" deep with a 5/16" drill. The above 
	process was followed without any issues and the bottom half of the hole was tapped. 
</p>

<p>
	The cross hole for clamping the stop to the ways is simpler. A through hole for a 
	1/4-20 cap screw was drilled with up to a 9/32" drill. The hole has not been 
	countersunk. The only 1/4-20 screw available has a round head. A slitting saw was 
	used to cut the slot. The saw was aligned with the middle of the hole for the rod 
	(or gauge) by eye. The cut was then taken in 0.010" increments. The cutting went 
	smoothly. A short 10-24 screw was installed in the hole. When a 3/8" rod (end mill) 
	was inserted in the hole, just a slight turn of the screw held it tight.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Stop slotted.jpg" alt="The stop with screw holes and slot" width="1945" height="1524">

<p>
	The next step is to make and fit the shoe. First the block of steel needs to be 
	squared up. This will be done in the shaper. Then it needs to be cut to dimension. 
	A hole for the dowel rod needs to be drilled. When the mating hole in the stop is 
	drilled the two can be put together to mark the clamp screw hole in the shoe. A 
	shallow slot also needs to be cut in the shoe per the plans.
</p>

<p>
	Used the shaper to square the ends of the block of steel for the shoe. Then continued 
	with the shaper to remove about 1/4" of material from one face. Started with 0.010" 
	cuts and then moved to 0.015" depth of cut. The finish was no different. The size did 
	not come out correct so redid the part. Cut off a 1&nbsp;7/16" length of 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" 
	rectangular steel with a hacksaw. The ends were squared up in the shaper and the 
	length reduced to 1&nbsp;3/8". The shoe was placed on parallels and the 1" width was 
	reduced to 7/8" in the shaper. 
</p>

<p>
	The shoe was aligned with the body of the stop and clamped. A transfer punch was 
	used to mark the location of the hole for the screw. The hole for the pin was 
	laid out 9/16" to the right of this first mark and on center. This mark was punched. 
	The shoe was transfered to parallels in the Sherline mill vise. It was center drilled 
	and drilled through with a #32 (0.116") drill. The hole was reamed with a 1/8" reamer. 
	The spindle was then aligned with the mark for the transfered hole. It was center 
	drilled and drilled through with a #7 drill. The hole was chamfered and tapped 1/4-20. 
</p>

<p>
	After repeating the drilling procedure in the correct location (though set the dowel 
	hole 7/16" from the center of the tapped hole). This hole was then transferred to the 
	body. The body was drilled #32 and tapped 1/8" to a 3/8" depth. A 3/4" length of 
	drill rod was placed in a collet and one end faced. This end had the diameter slight 
	reduced with a light cut and some sanding until it was a sliding fit in the dowel 
	hole in the body. This pin was then press fit (with a drop of loctite) into the shoe. 
	A picture of the two parts is included below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Shoe drilled.jpg" alt="The drilled and doweled shoe" width="2014" height="1329">
<img class=inline src="images/Body & shoe plan.jpg" alt="Closeup of the body and shoe plan" width="1705" height="1665">


<p>
	A slot now needs to be cut in the body side of the shoe around the tapped hole. From 
	the plans is appears to be about 1/64" deep. One side of the slot aligns with the 
	wall of the body that presses against the outside of the lathe way. I will postpone 
	slotting until I have cut the lathe way profile in the body. The profile can then be 
	used to accurately mark the edge of this slot. A closeup of the body and shoe detail 
	is shown above.
</p>

<p>
	The profile in the body will be cut on the shaper with a series of three cuts, if I 
	can figure out how to use the shaper for slotting. The first cut will be a square to 
	the main wall. It has an 11/32" arrow pointing to it. The second cut will be along 
	the surface that sits on the inside of the lathe way almost to the right angle where 
	the 17/32" arrow is pointing. Finally, the 45&deg; slot will be made.
</p>

<p>
	The first cut was made, but with the mill. The internal rattling in the shaper has 
	me worried about using it too much. The stop body was marked for depth, 5/16", and 
	for width of cut. It ended 29/32" from the center of the 3/8" hole. The body was 
	clamped in the vise, supported with a machinist's jack and clamped above the jack 
	with a strap clamp. Machining cast iron produces so much dust, I decided to use a 
	vacuum. After some ineffective attempts the nozzle was clamped in a vee block and 
	the vee block was clamped to the angle plate set at an angle. The setup is shown in 
	the photo below. The cuts were made 0,020" deep and 0.150" wide, except for the last 
	cuts against the wall that was 0.050"&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.050". A 5/16" end mill was used. 
	The cutting went well and little dust was left on the table. Thank goodness for my 
	hearing protection.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Stop milling setup.jpg" alt="Setup for milling the body" width="2207" height="1396">

<p>
	In order to cut the vee groove the clamping assembly needed to be moved to the right 
	side of the table. After numerous issues were dealt with the corner of the end mill 
	was aligned with the bottom corner of the vee groove. The cutter was lowered into the 
	work. It was then that a new problem arose: the end mill can't descend low enough. 
	With the head set at 45&deg; the lowest travel has been reduced so the end mill stops 
	about 1/4" too high. The part was already on parallels and held by about 1/4" in 
	the vise, so it could not be raised. Either the vise needs to be raised, the end 
	mill extended, or the vertical extension to the mill needs to be removed.
</p>

<p>
	Option 2 was selected. I have a second end mill collet for 1/4" end mill shafts. The 
	simplest plan was to make an adapter that would link this collet to the collet 
	holding the 5/16" end mill. A 1&nbsp;1/4" length of 3/4" aluminum hex was cut off 
	with the hacksaw. This was chucked in the lathe and faced. 5/8" was reduced to 1/4". 
	The end was chamfered. A flat was filed on this reduced portion. This 1/4" shaft was 
	put into the 1/4" end mill holder and attached to the spindle. About 1/2" of the 
	exposed hex was reduced until it was round. Thread relief was cut at 1/2" with the 
	parting tool. The lathe was set up for screw cutting. Threads, 3/4-16, were cut in 
	the part to a depth of 0.040". This was a little deep for a tight fit in the collet. 
	After clean up the adapter was complete. A photo of the finished adapter is shown 
	below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Collet adapter.jpg" alt="Collet to collet adapter" width="2207" height="1396">

<p>
	The extension is nice, but milling the part did not work. There was too much chatter. 
	I attempted to set the part on a 45&deg; angle with the angle plate holding the 
	vise, but this also resulted in significant chatter. So I took the vise on the angle 
	plate to the shaper. The angle plate did not fit in the shaper vise. The t-slots in 
	the shaper table were measured. These measurements were marked on the base of the 
	angle plate. 3/8" holes were drilled and chamfered. Perfect fit! The first picture 
	below shows the setup. I was able to get all the way to the bottom of the vee. (The 
	long side in this case.) It was necessary to stop the movement of the shaper as it 
	got close to the left side of the vee. This was then cleaned up with vertical 
	movement. That is the shaper was moved to the vertical surface, moved over 0.010", 
	and down 0.010" with each pass. When removed from the vise it was test fitted to the 
	lathe ways. It did not sit flush. the vertical side (in the second picture below) was 
	too close. So I will return it to the Sherline and do some side milling on it to open 
	the gap.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Vee shaped.jpg" alt="The vee groove as cut with the shaper" width="1662" height="1481">

<p class="note">
	Thinking it through now that the vee groove and other milling/shaping is complete. 
	A better way to accomplish the same work would be to thoroughly consider all steps 
	in the process and minimize the number of vise transfers. Each transfer comes with 
	error in the orientation. Keeping each cut square on a casting with no perpendicular 
	sides was impossible with the process used here. 
</p>

<p>
	The milling was completed. About 0.030" was removed. It now fits reasonably well on 
	the lathe ways. <em>It works and I am happy!</em> A picture shows the almost completed 
	stop attached to the South Bend lathe ways. I will need to order some 3/8" drill rod 
	to finish it off. Will also cut the slot in the shoe at that time.

<p>
	The 3/8" drill rod arrived. A 3" length was cut off with a hacksaw. The ends were 
	faced and chamfered. The shoe was finished this morning. A 1/2" wide slot was laid 
	out around the hole on the pin side. A 3/16" end mill was used to cut a slot 0.031" 
	deep in 0.005" increments. The initial slot was widened in 0.015" passes. The burrs 
	were removed and the bottom four edges were chamfered with a file. May decide to 
	paint it someday.
