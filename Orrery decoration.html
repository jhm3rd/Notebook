	Two things will cover the top frame: twelve months and thirteen constellations. 
	The months will be marked and labelled on the outside of the top, while the 
	constellation begin and end dates will be noted on the inside of the top. The 
	constellations will be represented across the to of each dodecagon section.
</p>

<p>
	Each section of the dodecagonal frame is 2 7/16" long on the outside edge for a 
	total of 29 1/4". This leaves 0.0801" per day. The month markings vary, of course, 
	but are always close to a corner. The 13 astronomical constellations vary widely 
	in length from Scorpius, 6 days, to Virgo, 44 days.
</p>

<p>
	A template was made by taping two pieces of Bristol paper together and tracing the 
	top frame onto these two sheets. The months were marked next, estimating where each 
	starting day fell based on 0.0801" per day. Using the same estimating technique, the 
	beginning of the constellations were marked as well. Finally the symbols for the 
	constellations and schematics of the constellations were added. A picture of this 
	template is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="orrDec/Frame template.jpg" alt="Completed Bearings" width="2444" height="2486">

<p>
	The plan is to somehow mark the month and constellation boundaries using some 
	sort of scratching or milling device. The names of the months and constellation 
	symbols will be engraved. The stars for the constellation diagrams will either be 
	punched or drilled, while the lines between stars will be engraved. Each constellation 
	diagram has at least one bright star and these need to be highlighted in some way. 
	This might be a drop of paint or a "jewel" glued into place. Painting the frame deep 
	blue followed by cutting the decorations through the paint is also a possibility. A 
	variety of approaches will be tried on scrap pieces of brass after sanding to 1000 
	grit and polishing.
</p>

<p>
	The 2" wide bottom gear support is quite heavy looking, so I decided to "lighten" it 
	up with planets. Holes will be laid out on the the support end opposite the crank. 
	This is about a 2" X 4" space. If the diameter of the top dodecagon (9.5") is set 
	equal to the diameter of the sun, then the diameter of Jupiter is 0.98". Similarly, 
	the diameters of the other planets are Saturn (0.83"), Uranus (0.35"), Neptune 
	(0.34"), Earth (0.087"), Venus (0.083"), Mars (0.044"), and Mercury (0.035"). The 
	diameter of Saturn's rings would be 2.5" beginning about 1/16" from Saturn's 
	surface. These won't fit so will be extended to the edge of the support and past 
	Jupiter, indicating their size without being explicit. The plan is to drill/bore 
	holes for each of the planets in a spiral with Saturn and its rings at the outermost 
	end of the support. The rings of Saturn would be indicated with a number of concentric 
	circles formed with a fly cutter. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="orrDec/Planet layout.jpg" alt="Proposed planet layout on support" width="2931" height="1850">

<p>
	The planet holes were laid out by hand on the bottom gear support. A spiral was 
	sketched and the planet hole locations were marked (measurements from top and left): 
	Saturn @ 1" & 1", Jupiter @ 9/16" & 2&nbsp;3/16", Uranus @ 7/8" & 3", Neptune @ 
	1&nbsp;3/8" & 3", Earth @ 1&nbsp;5/8" & 2&nbsp;3/4", Venus @ 1&nbsp;5/8" & 
	2&nbsp;7/16", Mars @ 1&nbsp;1/2" & 2&nbsp;3/16", and Mercury @ 1&nbsp;1/4" & 
	2&nbsp;1/16". The gear support was mounted on two vee blocks and clamped with strap 
	clamps. The sensitive drilling attachment was fitted to the mill and a #60, 0.040" 
	drill was chucked in place. The Mercury hole was drilled at high speed with lots of 
	pecking. This drilling was repeated for the Mars hole using a #57, 0.043" drill. 
	Venus was drilled with a #45, 0.082" drill and Earth with a #43, 0.089" drill. 
	Neptune and Uranus holes were drilled up to R, 0.339" and S, 0.348" drills 
	respectively. None were a perfect match for the diameters listed above, but were 
	as close as the available drills allowed and within the margin of error of 
	this comparison. All holes were lightly chamfered to provide a bright finish around 
	the lip.
</p>

<p>
	The Saturn hole was made next so cutting the rings through Jupiter would not be 
	interrupted cuts. It was drilled to 3/8" and then bored (0.0075" steps) to 7/8". 
	The boring went well after the boring bar was sharpened. The rings were then cut 
	every 0.050" with the boring bar to a depth of about 0.020". Jupiter was cut last. 
	Similar to Saturn the hole was drilled to 7/16" and then bored to 1". The hole was 
	started too close to the edge so it was moved with the boring bar about 1/8" toward 
	the center of the bar and then opened to full diameter. The edges of the holes were 
	deburred as needed. 
</p>

<p>
	The bottom support was then sanded with 320, 400, 1000, & 1500 grit paper. And finally 
	it was polished with red rouge on a cloth wheel. A picture of the result is below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="orrDec/Planet size chart.jpg" alt="Planet size chart on bottom support" width="1896" height="3720">

<p>
	A scrap piece of brass was sanded with 1500 grit paper and then polished with the 
	green polish on a cloth wheel in the drill press. Except for the scratches that the 
	sandpaper did not remove the finish was mirror-like.
</p>

<img class=inline src="orrDec/Practice polish.jpg" alt="Completed Bearings" width="2117" height="1720">

<p>
	After repeating the process on a number of wheels and the top frame, I was not 
	pleased with the results. There were tiny sanding scratches in places on all parts. 
	So I started with the unsanded Mars ring and carefully sanded it (220, 320, 400, 
	600, 1000, & 1500) making sure that no scratches were visible from previous grits 
	before moving to the next grit. This was helped by sanding each ensuing grit at 
	right angles to the previous grit direction. The final product was quite uniform 
	with no visible sanding scratches beyond those left by the 1500 grit paper. I am 
	going to polish with the new polishing setup after engraving. 
</p>

<p>
	I grabbed this potential signature panel from letterheadfonts.com. It might work well 
	on the bottom support as an inconspicuous place for a signature. And this 
	<a href="https://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/americanaornaments">author</a> has 
	some really pretty ornaments to use around text. Or 
	<a href="https://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/engraversornaments1">these.</a> Here

	An engraver's block and a Lindsay graver sharpening kit (with a 2000 grit stone) 
	were ordered today. The block is a $138 block from Amazon. Some reviews indicate 
	that it may need some work to make it completely functional. I figure that I can 
	put in a lot of work relative to the $500 savings versus a GRS or Lindsay block. 
	The sharpening kit requires a number of coarser stones, if the graver is sharpened 
	from scratch. It should be fine for resharpening my gravers with just the finer 
	grit stone.
</p>

<p>
	Since I have an extra dodecagon frame that is not quite flat, I decided to use it 
	to try out the decoration work planned for the top dodecagon. This consists of the 
	week lines, month lines, constellation lines, constellations, constellation 
	symbols, and month names. A fixture is needed to hold the dodecagon for the work, 
	so a 24" long X 7" wide board of 3/4" oak was cut in half. One long edge of each 
	piece was cleaned up on the table saw and the two 12" boards were glued and clamped 
	together by their long edges producing a 12" X 14" rectangle.  
</p>

<p>
	After significant fretting I will probably not use a wooden support on the rotary 
	table. There is no need for that level of precision and I am not going to make 
	week marks. At this point I plan to mark the months and the constellations with 
	1/4" lines. To this end a piece of polished brass was held in the mill vise and 
	the milling head tilted 45&deg;. [In order to make this work the vise needed to be 
	elevated about 1".] A number of cuts of varying depth were then made with a 1/8" 
	end mill. One set of cuts was made with movement on the y-axis giving a vee groove. 
	The other set of cuts was made with x-axis movement giving a round cut. The depths 
	of the cuts varied from 0.005" to 0.040". In both cross sections the shallowest 
	cuts were sufficient to clearly be seen. I prefer the round profile cuts, 
	specifically the shallowest 0.005" cut. They show more highlights. In addition the 
	end of the vee grooves are rounded on one side due to the round profile of the end 
	mill. Taking a picture of something so shiny is difficult, but the photo below 
	shows the differences between the round (right) and vee groove (left) cuts.
</p>

<img class=inline src="orrDec/Round vs Vee cuts.jpg" alt="Round and Vee cuts compared" width="1942" height="1464">

<p class=note>
	The nicely rounded ends of the round profile cuts came from pulling the end mill 
	into the work. That is the end mill was pointing down and to the left, while the 
	work was moved into the cutter from right to left.
</p>

<p class=note>
	On further thought this approach is a non-starter. There is no means to secure the 
	dodecagon in order to position the correct positions below the cutter. It is just 
	too large. It could be done by the vee groove method, but I don't like the look of 
	the end of the cut. Or maybe using a 45&deg; adapter for the vertical milling table 
	on the lathe?!? Simplest would be purchasing a 1/16" end mill and going with a flat 
	bottomed cut.
</p>

<p>
	The lines marking the month and constellation divisions should be set pretty 
	precisely. To that end the outer circumference of the frame is 29.25" giving 0.080" 
	per day. So a 28 day month is 2.244" (2 8/32"), a 30 day month is 2.404" (2 13/32"), 
	and a 31 day month is 2.484" (2 15.5/32"). In this way the months were remarked on 
	the diagram shown above. The constellations were marked using the data from the 
	following chart, where 32FPM stands for "32nds from prior month". Measurements for 
	the constellations were made on the outside and transferred to the inside.

	Next up was determining the best way to represent the constellations on the top 
	frame. Using Swarovskii crystals (the flat-backed ones usually seen glued to 
	fingernails and toenails) and just plain drilling were considered. I decided the 
	crystals might be too gaudy, so I explored drilling. Two drills were selected for 
	the two hole sizes needed (#45; 0.082" and #31; 0.120"). The small drill was tried 
	at a range of depths: 0.005", 0.010", 0.015", and 0.020". The larger drill was 
	tried at two depths: 0.020" and 0.035". The results of these attempts for the 
	simple constellation, Aries, can be seen on the left side of the picture below. 
	I preferred the looks of the 0.015" depth for the #45 drill and the 0.035" depth 
	for the #31 drill. Leo was drilled at these depths and is seen on the right. It 
	is a denser constellation than Aries in terms of number of stars in the standard 
	representation. I am not sure at this point whether or not to "connect the dots." 
	An attempt with a straightedge and a scribe looks pretty good.
</p>

<img class=inline src="orrDec/Constellation exploration.jpg" alt="Exploring drills and depths for stars" width="2676" height="1443">

<p>
	The extra frame was used for the following exploratory decoration. The month and 
	constellation boundaries were transferred from the large diagram and then cut in 
	the mill. A 1/16" end mill was used and the slot was milled 0.008" deep. Holding 
	the frame in the small vise on the Sherline mill worked out fine. Two parallels 
	were used and the vise was tightened while pressing down above the parallels. The 
	"horizontal accuracy" was checked by inspecting how tight the parallels were. The 
	slots were cut 0.175" long. The slots were then deburred with a small flat file. 
	The constellation markers had significant burrs, whereas the month markers had 
	little burr. This must be a consequence of the direction of the cut.
</p>

<p>
	The month abbreviations, constellation symbols and constellation stars were marked 
	with a Sharpie to determine where drilling and engraving would take place. A picture 
	of this layout is included below. When laying out the month markers I did not take 
	into account the correct location of the holes for the columns (I want January to be 
	at the top of the frame when the handle is on the right). So I ignored the holes in 
	this frame and marked where the holes will be in the real frame. The only real 
	challenges were fitting Scorpio and Ophiucus in November and December. They are 
	large constellations and they have very short periods of opposition.

	After multiple alternate projects the orrery is back at the top of the list. I 
	decided to try painting the planets. To this end some acrylic paint was purchased 
	at an art store. Earth: A base coating of blue will be applied first. This will 
	then be covered lightly with white paint to simulate the famous blue marble picture 
	of the earth from the moon. Venus: Simply a base coat of white applied thinly so 
	some brass shines through. Mars: Will also begin with a brass ball, but a reddish 
	brown paint will be applied. Mercury: May simply use an aluminum ball. Sun: A large 
	and highly polished brass ball is planned. Will probably spray coat all planets and 
	the sun with clear varnish as is planned for all of the polished brass parts.
</p>

<p>
	A couple of approximately 1/2" brass balls were made on the Sherline lathe using 
	the ball cutter. The free end was drilled and threaded and the ball was sanded to 
	1500 grit prior to parting it off. One ball was placed on a screw and "roughed up" 
	with 320 grit sand paper. A thin blue paint layer was brushed on (a bit of brass 
	could be seen in places). See <a href="Orrery planets.html">Orrery Planets</a> for 
	the completion of the planets.
</p>

<p>
	After finishing the planets (except maybe painting Mercury) it was time to return 
	to decorating the frame with months and constellations. This continued the work 
	from above. The frame was held in the Sjoberg vise. The engravers vise will need 
	a fixture of some sort to hold the frame. Three constellations were drilled. The 
	bright stars in each were drilled with a #45 drill just deep enough to produce a 
	full size (0.082") circle. The dimmer stars were drilled with a #0 starter drill. 
	Two months were sketched out with pencil on china white. Lines were drawn for upper 
	and lower case letters. These lines were 7/32" apart for upper case letters and 
	3/32" apart for lower case. The Savoye LET font was used. The letters were engraved 
	and the china white was removed with H<sub>2</sub>O. The photo below shows the 
	results. The letters are hard to see and the brass has yet to be polished. The 
	stars look pretty good, however.
</p>

<p>
	An attempt was also made to blacken the month/constellation markers. A painter's 
	spatula was heated with a propane torch, used to scrape up some dial wax, and 
	spread it into the month groove. Multiple problems were encountered: the spatula 
	cooled too quickly, the brass frame needed to be warm, and finally sanding removed 
	the wax from the groove. Doing this right is going to take some experimentation. 
</p>

<p>
	A woodburning set was purchased. The heated tool's temperature can be adjusted from 
	about 300&deg; to 450&deg;. The tool was plugged into the outlet and the control 
	set at 350&deg;. The tool tip chosen readily melted the dial wax and with a little 
	practice the melted wax was transferred to the machined marks in the dodecagon. 
	In some cases too much wax was added and probably should have been scraped off. 
	Sanding off this hardened wax was challenging. The real problem arose during the 
	sanding phase as once again only one of four grooves "waxed" retained the wax 
	upon sanding!! It is not clear why the wax sticks so well to the face of the 
	dodecagon and not to the bottom of the groove. An engraved month abbreviation, 
	"Aug", similarly did not retain the wax upon sanding.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Maybe alternative month and constellation marks need to be considered. One 
	possibility is to use a file and make triangular marks at the appropriate 
	locations. These could be made part way through the rim or all the way through. 
	The engraved month abbreviations and constellation symbols will need to be deeply 
	engraved to make them visible and bright.
</p>

<p>
	I like the triangle marker seen above. It looks different depending on the viewing 
	angle. Trivial to cut with a small triangular file, it produces polished cut faces 
	and clean edges. KISS!!
</p>

<p>
	The final consideration is font choice for the month abbreviations. I used Charm 
	from Google fonts for the toolbox name plaque and it was relatively simple to 
	engrave and looks pretty nice.

<p>
	Ok. On to the real thing! I removed the top frame from the partially assembled 
	orrery. Marks for the months and constellations were made with a Sharpie. The 
	constellations were printed and cut out. Each constellation was taped to the 
	dodecagon in the appropriate place. They were sized to pretty much span the full 
	width. It was a challenge to place the 3 constellations that are at opposition 
	in December. The plan is to drill the constellations first, followed by filing 
	the month and constellation marks. Room has been left for both month names 
	centered in each side of the dodecagon and constellation symbols that will be 
	placed just before each constellation.
</p>

<p>
	The holes were drilled for the constellations. Wound up just using the #45 drill 
	for both sizes of holes. The larger holes were drilled until the drill just broke 
	through the paper and the smaller holes were drilled about 0.025" shallower. This 
	was all done on the Sherline using a clamped piece of wood to "enlarge" the work 
	surface as seen in the following picture taken after all of the constellations 
	were completed.
</p>

<p>
	The marks for the months and constellations were then filed on the outside and 
	inside of the dodecagon respectively, at the marked locations. A small three-corner 
	file was used and held at about 20&deg;. Twenty to twenty-five strokes left the 
	desired length mark. 
</p>

<p>
	The month names pictured above seemed to be the perfect size for engraving. 
	Measurements were made and four lines were marked with a pencil on the china 
	white smears made for each month. The outermost line was 3/32" from the edge 
	of the dodecagon and the other lines were all separated by 3/32" as well. The 
	letters were sketched onto the china white as seen in the following photograph. 
	The line drawing and lettering were done while wearing the Optivisor.
</p>

<p>
	The graver was sharpened on the 2000 grit diamond stone. For some reason the angles 
	were off and new faces were cut on all three sides of the point! Not sure why, 
	but the graver was very sharp. Clamped the dodecagon in the vise as seen in the 
	following picture and proceeded to engrave the month abbreviations. The result 
	was pretty much as expected for the lack of practice. Seemed to mostly have 
	difficulty with cutting too deep. This may have been a result of the wooden 
	blocks in the vise being a little thicker than the brass so the angle of the 
	graver could not be lowered sufficiently.
</p>

<img class=inline src="orrDec/In vise.jpg" alt="In vise for engraving in" width="1972" height="2009">

<p>
	The astronomical symbols were layed out similarly to the month abbreviations. A 
	bottom line was marked 3/32" from the inside of the dodecagon to the side of each 
	constellation. The top line was drawn 3/16" above the bottom line. The symbols, 
	as seen in <a href="Orrery Overview.html">the overview</a>, were sketched between 
	the lines. Finally, they were engraved and came out better looking than the letters. 
	They are simpler than letters and I was better prepared for the depth of cut.
</p>

<p>
	Though not particularly happy with the engraved months I decided to proceed. The 
	brass needed to be polished and protected. The brass was polished after a minimal 
	sanding with 320 to 1000 grit paper. It was then washed with soap and water. Gloves 
	were worn during all of these processes. Finally the dodecagon was hung from a 
	paper clip in a cardboard box and spray painted with clear lacquer. There were a lot 
	of bubbles in the finish!
</p>

<p>
	Frustration with the poor paint job and the not so nice engraving caused thoughts 
	to turn to etching. A video from MyMechanic showed how nice engraved brass could 
	look, so it was time to do some experiments in etching. A number of items were 
	needed. First silicone paper was purchased (Avery Fabric Transfers). These use 
	heat (from an iron) to transfer the ink from paper to substrate. Second was 
	FeCl<sub>3</sub> solution as etchant. This is normally used for etching circuit 
	boards and was purchased from Frye's. The third purchase was fingernail polish 
	(Essence Gel Polish). This was used in the video to fill in the etched numbers. 
</p>	
	
<p>
	The paper was more expensive than expected so in order to maximize its value I 
	plan to print a page full of potential transfers. All of the letters or other 
	art work needs to be printed backwards as well as inverted, black for white. The 
	reverse image when transferred to the brass will be correct left to right and the 
	black ink will surround the white letters, which will be exposed to the etchant. 
	I am going to first experiment with the Charm font and size seen above. I will 
	also print out the constellations.
