<p class=first>
	The seven woodturning tools purchased for the class need to be stored somewhere. I 
	am tired of moving them from the table saw every time it is needed. A round stand like 
	an umbrella stand was considered, but there is no open floor space in the garage. 
	A tool holder sitting on the shelf above the lathe is the solution. It will consist 
	of two wooden faces connected by tubes set at an angle. The tools will slide into 
	the tubes. It will also have some holes to hold the other accessories like the tool 
	rest.
</p>

<p>
	Plastic plumbing pipe and wood were purchased. Two sizes of pipe, 2" and 1&nbsp;1/4", 
	were procured. A 2' section of the larger pipe and two 4' lengths of the smaller 
	should be sufficient for the tools. The gap between the two shelves is 11" and they 
	are 11" deep. The holder will be 12" wide. The wood is 3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;12" pine. 
	The holes will be cut at a 5&deg; angle to keep the tools from falling out.
</p>

<p>
	Two 11" lengths were cut from the purchased 4' board. The holes were laid out on the 
	front face: two 2" holes and six 1&nbsp;1/4" holes. This gave good spacing between 
	the holes and between the handles when full. The holes were laid out in the same 
	pattern on the back face, except they are 15/16" lower due to the angle. Cutting 
	the holes requires tilting the board by 5&deg;. Tilting the table is problematic as 
	only about half of the holes can be cut with one tilt. The other half require the 
	table be tilted the opposite direction. To eliminate the issue two supports were 
	made that were cut at a 5&deg; angle using the taper jig for the table saw.

	The holes were drilled this morning. The holes in the top row were drilled with 
	the small drill press in the basement. The second row of holes was drilled with the 
	large drill press in the garage. The 2" holes were drilled with a hole saw. The 
	smaller holes were drilled with the adjustable hole saw. The holes are all slightly 
	larger than the pipe, so some kind of thick glue is needed. The only thing I had on 
	hand was cement for locking concrete blocks together. After the pipes were cut to fit 
	this glue was applied with the caulking gun. It was almost impossible to keep the 
	back and front vertical and aligned. Luckily the glue dries slowly. 
</p>

<p>
	The sides with pipes glued in place was installed in the shelves. Screws were put 
	through the shelves to hold it in place. This project is completed. At least I 
	think it is complete. I won't know for sure until the glue dries and the tools are 
	in place.

	The glue was hard this morning, so the tools were put in place. The woodturning tool 
	holder works like a champ! I should label the holes as the tool handles all look the 
	same. A little paint might also be nice. Improvements will await warmer weather.
