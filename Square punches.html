<p class=first>
	I am taking a woodworking class in a few weeks to make a Greene and Greene side 
	table. The tool list includes three square punches (1/4", 5/16", & 3/8") available 
	from Lee Valley. They cost $37.50 apiece! I think I will make them. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="squPun/Sp lee valley.jpg" alt="Lee Valley's 1/4" square punch" width="1229" height="1326">

<p>
	My plan is to take a length of drill rod and drill the end to slightly less than 
	the desired square size. The hole will be chamfered so the diameter of the chamfer 
	equals the diagonal of the square. The end of the rod will be squared up in the mill. 
	This will hopefully produce the sharp arcs for cutting wood. An alternative to 
	chamfering would be to bore out the opening at an angle.
</p>

<p>
	The exact dimensions are the next issue to consider. The length of the square section 
	is 1/2". The walls should be thin but sturdy. The website recommends drilling the 
	hole 3/64" smaller than the size of the square, implying that 3/128" is removed from 
	each side.I am going to shoot for 1/32" thick steel walls. Decided to make four 
	punches, 3/16", 1/4", 5/16", and 3/8". The wall dimension implies the holes drilled 
	into the four punches should be 1/8", 3/16", 1/4", and 5/16". 
</p>

<p>
	In order to square the round stock an indexing jig needs to be made. I have one for 
	indexing six faces, but not one for four. It is simply a piece of hex steel with 
	one end reduced and threaded for the chuck. This jig was made identically to the 
	<a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Index%20block.html">
	Index Block</a>, but with 1" square aluminum. The finished indexing jig is shown 
	below.
</p>

<p>
	A 2.5" length of 1/2" drill rod was cut off with a hacksaw. One end was faced and 
	drilled 0.128" to 1/2" depth. A countersink was used to cut the internal taper. It 
	was drilled to a depth that gave a 0.265" diameter, which is the diagonal of a 3/16" 
	square. The first 1/2" of the rod was reduced to 0.26". The face at 1/2" was 
	chamfered. The rod was flipped in the chuck and the distal end was faced and 
	chamfered. The end was sanded. The punch at this stage is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="squPun/SP punch from lathe.jpg" alt="The punch before squaring the end" width="1283" height="1557">

<p>
	The square punch to be was mounted in the three jaw chuck. The chuck was screwed onto 
	the indexing jig. The jig was held in the vise on the milling table. A machinist's 
	jack supported the end to be cut. This arrangement is shown in the first photo below. 
	Each side was machined in succession. A four flute 3/8" end mill was used to remove 
	0.005" of material in three passes. A total of 0.035" was removed on each side. The 
	final measurements for the two dimensions are 0.187" and 0.189". The almost 
	finished square punch is shown in the second photo below.

<p>
	The business end of the punch was heated with a propane torch until the end was cherry 
	red. Care was taken not to burn the end. The end was quenched in oil and allowed to 
	cool.  The punch at this stage is seen below. The four faces of the punch were sanded 
	from 180- to 2000-grit sand paper. The punch was tried out in a piece of cherry. A 
	hole was drilled with a #28 drill (0.140").  The punch was centered over the hole. 
	(Nearly impossible to do by eye.)A hammer was used  to drive the punch into the wood. 
	The punch had to be removed frequently to remove the loose chips. The photo shows the 
	results.

	The following table shows the dimensions for various aspects of these punches. The 
	depth of the countersink from the drilled hole to the diagonal size is calculated 
	with the following formula: z = (y - x)/(2 * tan41&deg;). The included angle of the 
	countersink is 82&deg;.

	Now I need to make the 1/4", 5/16" and 3/8" square punches. Three blanks were cut to 
	2&nbsp;1/2", two from 1/2" drill rod and one from 7/16" drill rod. Both ends were 
	faced in the South Bend lathe. As above the ends were drilled first 1/2" deep with 
	3/16", 1/4", and 5/16" drills. The holes were chamfered so the resulting diameters 
	were the same as the square's diameter. Making the three went quickly on the South 
	Bend. I attempted to temporarily attach a set of calipers to the tailstock to closely 
	determine the depth of the countersink drilling. It did not work effectively. There 
	was too much play. The countersink drilling was determined by eye. Drill a bit and 
	check for tangency to outer diameter.
</p>

<img class=inline src="squPun/SP three punch blanks.jpg" alt="Three punches after the lathe work" width="1553" height="1543">

<p>
	The three parts from the lathe were again held in the three jaw chuck and with the 
	aid of the indexing jig all four faces were cut to the depth listed in the table 
	above. The resulting machined square punches are shown below. Took a break to install 
	new window well covers.
</p>

<img class=inline src="squPun/SP three machined punches.jpg" alt="Three punches after machining square" width="1662" height="1598">

<p>
	I decided to modify the angle of the internal taper on these three punches. Chisels 
	are 20&deg;. The headstock was set at -20&deg; and the boring tool was used to slowly 
	adjust the internal 41&deg; angle. It was far from a perfect solution, but it 
	worked when 0.002" increments were removed. The three punches were heat treated and 
	sanded to 2000 grit. The four completed square punches are shown in all their glory 
	below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="squPun/SP four finished punches.jpg" alt="Four square punches completed" width="1540" height="1900">

<p>
	With the square punches in hand a box is needed to store them safely. The plan is 
	to use a scrap of 1" thick cedar(?). The body of the box, 
	3&nbsp;5/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3&nbsp;1/8",  will have four holes and the dovetail on 
	the two ends. The top, 3&nbsp;5/16&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4", will have the mating dovetail 
	pins with the central 2&nbsp;5/16" cut out. 
</p>

<p>
	The wood was ripped to 3&nbsp;5/16" wide using the fence. Using the miter gauge the 
	top was cut off at 3/4" and then the bottom was cut from the scrap at 3&nbsp;1/8". 
	The dado blade set was installed in the table saw. The openings were removed from 
	both the top and body to a depth of 3/8", leaving 1/2" of wood on each of the ends.
</p>

<img class=inline src="squPun/SP top and body.jpg" alt="The top and body of the box" width="1934" height="1851">

<p>
	Next was cutting the dovetails on both ends of the body and the pins on the top ends. 
	The marking gauge was used to scribe lines at 3/8" on three sides of the body. It 
	was also used to scribe a line on the ends of the top for the pins. The protractor 
	was used to draw lines for the pins on one end of the top. The lines were run around 
	the corner, across the bottom, and transfered to the other end. 
</p>

<p>
	The pull saw was used to cut on the lines. Both were cut simultaneously. This turned 
	out to be a mistake as was transferring the lines from one end to the other. There 
	was insufficient accuracy in both operations. The waste was removed with a chisel to 
	the scribed line.
</p>

<img class=inline src="squPun/SP pins cut.jpg" alt="The dovetail pins cut in the top" width="1882" height="1359">

<p>
	The pins were aligned with the ends of the body and the pattern was transfered using 
	the woodworking knives. The pins were cut with the saw and cleaned up with the 
	chisel. There is a lot of slop, but after some cleanup things were acceptable.
</p>

<p>
	The holes were laid out between the tails on the body. The outside holes were aligned 
	so the tails would be tangent to the holes. 1/16" was left between the holes. All 
	were drilled 1/2" to a depth of 2&nbsp;1/4". The last hole needs to be opened to 
	7/16", but I have not found a drill this size!
</p>

<img class=inline src="squPun/SP body and top.jpg" alt="The top and body of box almost complete" width="1712" height="2173">

<p>
	Besides the ugly dovetails multiple other problems began to raise their heads. Two 
	of the holes were crooked and the punch would not fit in them. I did not want to try 
	boring out the fourth hole. I could envision multiple problems causing disaster. I 
	decided to skip the box for now. Maybe with some fresh ideas something else will be 
	made.
</p>

<p>
	Had another idea overnight. Two 3/4" boards will make the bottom and top. Four slots 
	for the punches and four slots for the matching drills. After laying out both items 
	on the wood marks were made for the punch slots. The ends of the slots were drilled 
	with a 3/8" drill for end mill access. The 3/8" end mill was used to cut the slots 
	in increments of 0.1" to 0.275" deep. The slots were measured on the first board 
	and the measurements transferred to the second. The photo shows the two halves at 
	this stage.
</p>

<img class=inline src="squPun/SP punch slots milled.jpg" alt="The top and bottom of box with punch slots cut" width="2029" height="1334">

<p>
	After completing the slots for the drills the slots were not sufficiently aligned for 
	the top to fit on the bottom when the punches and drills were in place. The top was 
	hollowed out producing one large square depression. The slots and the depression were 
	cleaned up with chisels. The depression was sanded to 320 grit. The top and bottom 
	were clamped together and sanded on the belt sander to produce a good fit. The entire 
	assembly was sanded to 320 grit and the corners slightly rounded. The box was 
	completed by adding a hinge, a catch, and some foam in the top. The pictures below 
	show the result. The four walnut plugs repaired a drilling error.
</p>

<img class=inline src="squPun/SP case 1.jpg" alt="The closed case showing the hinge" width="2209" height="2012">
<img class=inline src="squPun/SP case 2.jpg" alt="The closed case showing the catch" width="2515" height="2068">
<img class=inline src="squPun/SP completed.jpg" alt="The open case with punches and drills" width="2578" height="1535">

<p>
	Took the new punches to class. I asked the question: how do you align the punches to 
	the hole? It turns out the punches are drilled through and the drill aligns the 
	punch! So that night I put the punches back in the flame to red and let them cool 
	slowly on the bench top. They were drilled through. For the larger two drilling 
	started with 1/4" and went up to the correct size (punch size - 3/64") for that 
	punch. The 1/4" punch was drilled with a 13/64" bit. The drilling had to be done very 
	slowly and many stops for chip removal. The punches were rehardened as before. The 
	newly hardened punches were sanded with 1000, 1500, and 2000 grit paper on the 
	cutting faces.
</p>

<p class="note">
	It might be possible to find a diamond cone with a 40&deg; included angle to sharpen 
	the inner faces of the punches.
</p>

<p>
	The 5/16" punch does not allow the drill to slide through. There is a catch about 
	1.5" from the business end. It was returned to the lathe and the drill that will 
	remain with the punch set, 17/64", was used to ream the hole multiple times. There 
	is still a catch. The non-business end was drilled about 1&nbsp;1/4" deep with a 
	9/32" drill. Now the 17/64" drill slides through and there should still be enough 
	hole at 17/64" to properly align the drill.
</p>

<p>
	The box was treated with tung oil three times over three days and then waxed.
