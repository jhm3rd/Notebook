<p class=first>
	Decided to assemble the orrery today. I have never seen it put together after 
	polishing the various parts. As it was assembled I discovered that at least six 
	screws are missing. The assembly was documented with many photos. I did the assembly  
	on top of the footstool desk. The camera was "mounted" on the magnifier/part holder, 
	which sat on top of the machinist's tool chest. The lighting was not ideal. At least 
	two photos accompany each step. The first is the assembly up to that point accompanied 
	by the next set of parts. The second is this set of parts added to the assembly. All 
	of the parts except for the screws were made in my shop. First the feet were placed 
	in the base. These also serve as screws to attach to the columns seen later.
</p>

<p>
	Then the bottom frame was assembled. The bottom support has a number of holes drilled 
	through to show relative planet sizes. The holes sizes represent the planet size, if 
	the sun were the diameter of the orrery as a whole. In the third photo below Saturn is 
	on the far left with its rings sketched out. Jupiter is to Saturn's right. The rest of 
	the planets follow clockwise around an arc: Uranus, Neptune, Earth, Venus, Mars, and 
	finally tiny Mercury. Mercury's size is not accurate as I do not have a drill small 
	enough. The bottom support bracket is screwed to plates, which are then screwed 
	to the bottom of the bottom dodecagon. The dodecagon is set on the feet.
</p>

<p>
	Installing the worm was next. Two thick washers were placed on the worm shaft on 
	either side of the worm. These washers keep the worm from moving sideways along the 
	direction of shaft. The bearings were placed outside these washers and they were 
	screwed to the bottom support bracket. The handle connecting tube was attached 
	to the worm shaft with a set screw. The worm shaft is slotted like a screw, so the 
	mating, screwdriver-like, handle shaft can turn it and be easily removed. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	The third bearing block should probably be installed at this point and a straight edge 
	used to align the three bearing blocks. When the gear stacks are installed the 
	bearing blocks may need further adjustment to provide smooth operation.
</p>

<p>
	There are two gear stacks. The first I call the fixed gear stack. This stack is 
	turned by the worm (1/26 of a full revolution or two weeks for each full turn of the 
	worm). It consists of 5 gears. The bottom gear is called the wheel and it mates with 
	the worm. It has 26 teeth. The next gear up, the largest, is one half of the Mercury 
	gear pair. Up next is the fixed gear for Venus. Then come the fixed gears for Earth 
	and Mars. Each gear is separated from the gears on either side by thin brass washers. 
	The gears in the fixed gear stack all need to turn in sync with the worm and wheel. 
	To fix the gears together a second shaft or pin passes through holes in the gears.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Assembly driver gears 1.jpg" alt="Driver gear stack parts" width="2227" height="2410">
<img class=inline src="images/Assembly driver gears 2.jpg" alt="Driver gear stack assembled and attached" width="2264" height="2145">

<p>
	The fixed gear stack meshes with and turns the independent gear stack gears. These 
	gears rotate independently of each other constrained only by their partner in the 
	fixed gear stack. The rotation speed of the independent gears depends on the ratio of teeth 
	between the fixed gear and the independent gear. The Earth gears both have 39 teeth. 
	Twenty-six turns of the worm turns the Earth through one full year. For Mars the 
	fixed gear has 27 teeth and the independent gear has 51 teeth. The ratio of the two 
	gears along with the ratio relative to the number of teeth on the Earth gears sets the speed of Mars 
	relative to Earth's speed around the sun.
</p>
	
<p>
	Getting the correct ratios was part of 
	the challenge in selecting the best gear pairs. Another constraint in the gear 
	selection process is that all pairs of gears have to have the same total number of 
	teeth, otherwise they won't mesh (78 was chosen). The third and final constraint was 
	also practical. Cutting gears with fewer than 12 teeth is very difficult and cutting 
	more than 100 teeth is too time consuming, since the teeth are cut one at a time. 
	With all of that considered the gear ratios used here were selected from the 100 or so 
	possibilities explored as they gave the smallest errors: 0.1% for Mars, 0.6% for 
	Venus, 0.7% for Mercury. The spacer shown in the second photo below is to set this 
	gear stack above the height of the worm and wheel.
</p>

<p>
	A final aspect of these independent gears worth noting can be seen in the photos. Each 
	gear is mounted (soldered) to a tube. The smallest gear on the right is attached to 
	the narrowest and longest tube. This gear/tube drives Mercury. Its gear sits on the 
	bottom of the stack, but its ring sits the highest in the assembled orrery. So its 
	tube needs to slide through the others. Mars's tube is difficult to see in the shadow. 
	It is the shortest and fattest tube. The Mars gear sits at the top of the stack and 
	its ring is on the bottom of the four rings. So it has the shortest tube. Its tube is 
	the widest because the other four tubes must slide through it. 
</p>

<p>
	The columns and the handle bearing were added to the assembly next. The columns are 
	screwed to the feet and sit on top of the bottom dodecagon. The bearing for the 
	handle shaft is screwed to the bottom dodecagon. (Interesting how the reflected light 
	makes the bearing look blue in the photos.)
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Assembly columns 2.jpg" alt="Columns and handle bearing attached" width="2206" height="2271">

<p>
	The top frame is added next. It holds the tops of the two gear stacks in a fixed 
	position relative to one another. It consists of two parts, the upper dodecagon and 
	the top frame support bracket. This latter is screwed to the dodecagon and the whole 
	is set on the columns. The top dodecagon is then screwed to the columns with the 
	column caps seen in photo 2.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Assembly top frame 3.jpg" alt="Top frame in place" width="2276" height="2157">

<p>
	The planet rings are added next so the assembly finally looks like an orrery. The 
	four planet rings each consist of three parts: the ring, the planet and the attaching 
	collar. The aluminum collars attach to the back of the ring with three screws. A 
	set screw mounted in the collar afixes the collar to the corresponding planet tube. 
	The planets are small metal balls. Two were made from brass, one from aluminum, and 
	one from steel. Three were then painted, Mars, Earth and Venus. Mercury was left as 
	a polished steel ball. The planets are attached to the rings with a screw. For this 
	assembly the planet positions do not reflect their current location in their orbits.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Assembly planet rings 3.jpg" alt="Top frame in place" width="2276" height="2157">

<p>
	A few finishing touches completed the assembly. The sun is just a brass ball sanded 
	a bit to look interesting. It is screwed to a shaft that runs up through the center 
	of the Mercury tube. Both shafts eventually need to be permanently attached to the 
	bottom support frame. (An alternative to permanent attachment is affixing a small 
	plate under the two holes for the gear shafts.) At this time the shaft rests on a 
	block of wood hidden under the frame. The handle consists of three parts: the shaft 
	with the screwdriver-like end, the curved connector and the knob. These three parts 
	are assembled with two screws. The shaft slides in through the handle bearing and 
	slots into the worm shaft.

<p>
	The final photos are superflous. There is an additional shot of the assembled orrery. 
	There are also two photos of the orrery under its glass dome. (The dome needs to be 
	cleaned!) Note that the handle is removable so the dome can fit over the orrery. The 
	handle is stored under the bottom frame.

	A final shot highlights the gears beneath the planet rings. Note that the Mars ring 
	is attached too low.
