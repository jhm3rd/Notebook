<p class=first>
	It has been at least a year since I purchased a digital readout for the South Bend 
	cross slide. When travel distance along the bed is important, I have used the stop 
	with a dial indicator installed. If I can get this DRO installed, I will always 
	know how much the tool has moved. The DRO was purchased from Shars. It is about 
	two feet long and the measuring bit sits out from the lathe when installed by about 
	1/4". It comes set up to mount to the lathe with screws. The first three photos below 
	show the DRO, an end bracket, and the sliding detector.
</p>

<p>
	My plan is to mount the rail with two strong magnets as I don't want to drill into 
	the lathe. The measuring device will be mounted to the taper attachment. In order to 
	do this a horizontal plate will be screwed to the bottom of the taper attachment. 
	(See the last photo above.) The two screws holding the gib in place are about 8" 
	apart. They are approximately 1&nbsp;1/2" out from the lathe bed. The horizontal 
	plate will hold a vertical plate that will mount to the back of the measuring device. 
	It has to fit in the 1/4" gap between the measuring device and the lathe.
</p>

<p class="note">
	If the magnets do not stick well to the DRO mounting brackets, the brackets will be 
	screwed to small steel plates. The pull strength of these magnets between two steel 
	plates is 45 lbs. It is 30 lbs between the magnet and a steel plate.
</p>

<p>
	A piece of 3/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;12" aluminum was found in the box. It was 
	marked at 9" and cut with the horizontal bandsaw. I decided to go with the steel 
	plates for the mounting brackets. Some 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/4" bar stock was 
	located. Two 1&nbsp;9/16" lengths were marked out and cut with the bandsaw. The ends 
	and edges were cleaned up with a file. These and the cross slide mount are pictured 
	below.
</p>

<p>
	I am not sure exactly where to put the holes in the cross slide mount. The distance 
	from screw holes to the detector mounting plate will be covered by making slots 
	instead of holes. To get the distance between them right the gib mounting plate was 
	removed. The plate along with a 5/16" transfer punch was used to transfer the holes 
	to the aluminum plate about 3/8" in from each end. A compass was used to make arcs 
	and the arcs were connected with a straightedge and scribe.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbdroM/SBDRO plate clamped.jpg" alt="The slot laid out and the plant clamped for drilling" width="1623" height="1663">


<p>
	The aluminum plate was mounted on vee blocks and the holes were drilled with a 
	center drill and then a 5/16" drill. This is seen in the first picture. This 
	clamping arrangement was not sufficient for milling so the plate was moved to the 
	vise on parallels. The slots were cut in four passes with a 5/16" end mill. The 
	slots and edges were deburred. The photo shows the almost completed plate.
</p>

<p>
	The magnets arrived this morning. They are 3/4" in diameter and 3/8" thick. They are 
	strong. It is extremely difficult to get one off of the stack pictured below.
</p>

<p>
	The part of this that will attach to the sliding detector will be made from 1/16" 
	thick aluminum plate. The sliding detector pictured above is 
	1&nbsp;9/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2&nbsp;15/16". The four outer holes span 1&nbsp;9/16" the 
	long way and 11/32" the short way. The holes are 0.609" from the long edge and 0.688" 
	from the short edge. The provided screws for attaching the sliding detector measured 
	0.116" in diameter. This is a bit big for a 4-40 and small for a 3.5&nbsp;X&nbsp;.6. 
	I could not get a 4-40 nut on the screw and upon close inspection the threads do not 
	align with 4-40 screw threads: probably metric. I will use a 9/64" drill for 
	clearance.
</p>

<p>
	Four holes were laid out and drilled before I noticed my mistake. Should have at 
	least drawn the part before cutting or drafted it in Fusion 360. The part needs 
	two holes along one long edge to attach it to the edge of the cross slide mount. 
	Aligning the parts revealed that one pair of holes can still be used. I doubt four 
	are needed. The alignment also indicates some relief needs to be cut in the mount 
	for the cord protruding from the top of the sliding detector.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbdroM/SBDRO sd plate.jpg" alt="The plate for mounting the sliding detector" width="1599" height="1225">

<p>
	Two holes were drilled through the detector plate. They were spaced 1/4" in from the 
	short side and 3/32" in from the long side. They were drilled with a 0.140" drill. 
	These holes were used to mark the edge of the aluminum mounting plate. The holes were 
	located about 3.25" in from each end. These holes were drilled and tapped for 4-40 
	screws. The screws were cut off and a washer (#6) was used. The assembled plates 
	are shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbdroM/SBDRO plates.jpg" alt="The two assembled plates" width="2030" height="1926">

<p>
	The mounting brackets on the ends of the DRO only have one hole or slot for a screw. 
	This will be used to attach the 1/4" thick steel plates for magnetic attachment. The 
	size of the holes in the brackets is clearance for a #8 screw. I have some 1/2" #10 
	screws that also fit through these clearance holes. The plates were drilled on center 
	and tapped for a 10-32 screw. A stack of four washers was used instead of cutting the 
	screws shorter. The attached magnet plates are shown below.
</p>

<p>
	After lunch it was time to put it all together. Everything was moved to the garage 
	and the area behind the lathe was cleared out. With the mounting bracket attached to 
	the DRO, the DRO was held in position. The first difficulty appeared. The large 
	aluminum mounting plate was too wide. Part of the taper attachment drops below its 
	level and kept the plate from fitting. It was about 1/4" too wide. I marked a line 
	1/2" from one long side and used a hacksaw to cut the 9" length. It had to be cut 
	from both sides. The cut was very straight and they met perfectly in the middle.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbdroM/SBDRO saw kerf.jpg" alt="The saw cuts from both ends meeting in the middle" width="1197" height="2692">

<p>
	The cut was cleaned up with a file and the edges slightly chamfered. The next problem 
	was the lathe's screws did not fit in the slots. They fit in the drilled holes, but 
	not the slot. This was fixed by filing the slots. The first photo shows the plate at 
	this stage. The second photo shows a 1/4" overlap of the mounting plate with the 
	taper attachment after screwing it in place with the DRO attached. This left the 
	feet about 1/4" from the lathe bed side. The mount was moved away from the lathe a 
	further 1/8" to accomodate the 3/8" magnets.
</p>

<p>
	The magnets were inserted between the DRO bracket plates and the lathe bed. Multiple 
	measurements followed by adjustments were made, so the DRO was parallel with the 
	lathe bed in two directions. The distance from the bottom of the ways to the top of 
	the DRO is slightly less than 2". The distance from the outside of the DRO bar to the 
	lathe behind it is 1&nbsp;3/16". Measurement showed these numbers to be consistent at 
	the ends and adjacent to the mounting plate. It was time to try it out... Hmmm, it 
	is not aligned somehow. Moving the carriage with the hand wheel moves the entire DRO! 
	I decided to stop and give it some thought. Below are two shots of the mounted DRO.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbdroM/SBDRO mounted 1.jpg" alt="The first DRO mounting" width="2359" height="1368">
<img class=inline src="sbdroM/SBDRO mounted 2.jpg" alt="The second DRO mounting" width="2558" height="1715">

<p>
	A set of calipers was used to measure the alignment of the DRO. It was off by more 
	than I thought. The distance between the DRO and the lathe bed was within 0.020". It 
	was the vertical distance that was significantly off. When this was adjusted by 
	shifting the ends of the DRO, the error was also dropped below 0.020". Both sets of 
	measurements were difficult to take. The DRO still moved when the carriage was moved.
</p>

<p> 
	The screws holding the mounting plate to the gib were loosened and then retightened 
	just finger tight. This allowed play in the mounting plate, i.e. it could slip along 
	the screws slightly at both ends. The DRO no longer visibly moved with the carriage. 
	The DRO was turned on and set to zero at the stop. Movement away from the stop and
	returning to the stop did not provide the accuracy needed. Returning to the stop 
	showed a reading from -0.020 to +0.020". I was unable to feather the tightness to 
	remove the play and not clamp down on the DRO.
</p>

<p>
	One other possibility came to mind while laying in bed. The casting for the gib 
	might not be uniform. It was measured this morning. It varies from 0.390" at one 
	end to 0.425" at the other. Might this be the culprit for the dragging? I will shim
	the thinner end and see if that eliminates the problem.
</p>

<p>
	The thinner end was shimmed with a 1/32" thick strip of brass. There was still 
	movement, though usually less than 0.01". The magnets will be replaced by screws! 
	Two new 3/8" spacers were needed to replace the magnets. Two scraps of 2" round 
	aluminum were found. One had a large through hole. The other was drilled up to 1/2" 
	on the South Bend. It was faced to 0.375" and all edges chamfered. The other aluminum 
	spacer only needed to be faced to 0.375". 
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbdroM/SBDRO new spacers.jpg" alt="The two 3/8 inch aluminum spacers" width="1465" height="1144">

<p>
	The magnet and spacer were removed from the tailstock end. The opening in the DRO 
	bracket was marked on the lathe. A hole was drilled and tapped 10-24. This hole went 
	into a connector between the two sides of the lathe bed. It was drilled about 5/8" 
	deep before tapping. The hole in the steel spacer was opened to 7/32". It and the 
	aluminum spacer were installed between the lathe and the bracket with a 1&nbsp;1/4" 
	10-24 SHCS.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbdroM/SBDRO bracket attached.jpg" alt="The tailstock bracked attached to the lathe bed" width="1424" height="1384">

<p>
	Drilling a hole for the headstock bracket was another kettle of fish. It was situated 
	just between the motor and the lathe. There was not enough room to fit the cordless 
	drill. Two shorter corded drills were also tried, but neither came close. I located 
	the never-before-used right angle drill adapter. One end was mounted to a chuck, 
	while the other ended in a socket threaded 3/8-24. An adapter was needed. A 3" long 
	scrap of 1/2" aluminum was chucked in the Sherline lathe. The end was faced and 
	center drilled. The diameter was reduced to 0.375" for a length of 2" using a 
	tailstock center. The shaft was held in a vise and the reduced end was threaded with 
	a 3/8-24 die. The first time the die went on crooked and gave really wonky threads. 
	These threads were cut off and the shaft was rethreaded correctly. The device has 
	some wiggle to it, but it was usable.
</p>

<img class=inline src="sbdroM/SBDRO right angle.jpg" alt="The right angle attachment with adapter fitted to the cordless drill" width="1790" height="1886">

<p>
	The DRO was attached at the tailstock end and the free headstock end was marked for 
	drilling. The right angle adapter with drill bit installed was used to drill the 
	hole. It went reasonably well when the correct speed was found. The speed was almost 
	too fast for the wiggling adapter. This hole went through the side of the lathe bed. 
	It was tapped 10-24. The two spacers were held behind the bracket while a screw was 
	installed. A ruler was used to make sure both ends were sitting 1&nbsp;3/16" below 
	the bottom edge of the ways. This distance matched the same measurement near the 
	cross slide attachment. With everything attached the carriage moved smoothly.
</p>

<p>
	After tightening the stop so it would not move. the carriage was moved to the stop. 
	The DRO was turned on and zeroed. The carriage was moved away and back to the stop 
	repeatedly. There was never more than 0.001" error. Usually the carriage returned to 
	0.000!

<p>
	The last task was mounting the readout. It came with a blue plastic bracket. This 
	bracket was screwed to the corner of the bulletin board propped behind the lathe. 
	The readout was mounted. It is shown in the photo below.
