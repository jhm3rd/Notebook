<p class=first>
	I purchased an old professional microscope for $20 at the Tri-State Antique Market in 
	Lawrenceburg at the beginning of the month. It is time to restore it. The initial 
	documentation of this restoration will mostly consist of pictures. The biggest 
	challenge will be keeping all of the parts in some sort of order. The first four 
	photos show the dirty microscope in all its glory.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope 4.jpg" alt="Dirty microscope 4" width="2106" height="2767">

<p>
	The next two photos show the light management apparatus below the stage or table. It 
	consists of a filter (thought this was a cap initially) and a diaphragm. The two 
	photos after these are of the three lenses. The last of the following five shows 
	the diaphragm with its rust.
</p>

<p>
	The next photo shows the name of the Italian company, Officine Galileo, that made 
	the microscope. They are a well known maker of scientific instruments. The serial 
	number is also shown. I saw similar microscopes for sale on the internet from the 
	same company. They had much higher serial numbers and were made in the 60's.
</p>

<p>
	This photo shows the stage with the two slide clips installed.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope clips.jpg" alt="The slide clips installed on the stage" width="2106" height="2032">

<p>
	The next photo shows the filter on the light stage. It is blue glass, which I didn't 
	realize until it was removed. The glass is easily replaced, implying the microscope 
	came with interchangeable filters.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope filter.jpg" alt="The blue light filter" width="2083" height="2277">

<p>
	The next sequence of ten photos documents the removal of the light stage and 
	taking it apart. The two large screws were removed first. These screws hold the stage 
	in place. Three smaller screws hold the light management apparatus to the stage. The 
	filter holder was held in place with one screw that had a unique washer embedded in 
	the hole. The diaphragm was unscrewed from the light focusing lens. The diaphragm 
	unscrewed from its holder. Notice the three tiny screws. The last photo shows the 
	tiny screws held by a magnet so they won't get lost.

<p>
	The next four photos show the three primary lenses removed and the resulting angry 
	alien or lens holder. One screw held it in place on a square ended shaft.

<p>
	The next part removed was the top plate trapping the rack slide. It holds a spring in 
	a hole underneath.
</p>

<p>
	With the top plate removed the slide and the image tube can be slid up and off.

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope slide off.jpg" alt="The slide slid up and off" width="2105" height="1983">

<p>
	The next three photos show the removal of the dovetail from the image tube. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope dovetail off.jpg" alt="The dovetail removed" width="1988" height="2471">

<p>
	The next four pictures show the fine adjust pawl. It is broken as seen in two of the 
	photos. The movement in the coarse adjust was tight enough that it is understandable 
	how such a thin bit of steel would break. The screw has an odd washer.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope frame sans pawl.jpg" alt="The frame after removing the pawl" width="3024" height="4032">

<p>
	The next task was removing the fine adjust knobs from the frame. Both knobs have set 
	screws holding them in place. One set screw was loosened and the knob removed. There 
	is a screw in the shaft of unknown purpose. It was also removed. There are two screws 
	holding the flange and shaft in place. Both were removed. The shaft and opposite knob 
	slid out of the frame.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope frame sans fine.jpg" alt="The frame after removing the fine adjust shaft" width="1484" height="2228">

<p>
	The next five photos show the separation of the frame into the base and the upper 
	support. The nut on the end of the shaft requires a pin wrench. Luckily the holes 
	were big enough to accept the tips of a small pair of needle nose pliers. There are 
	a number of screws in the frame that serve no obvious purpose. They were removed.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope frame apart.jpg" alt="The two parts of the frame separated" width="1705" height="2149">

<p>
	The next set of pictures shows the separation of the coarse adjustment mechanism 
	from the image tube. At one point a hidden screw had to be removed via a provided 
	hole. The rack is buried in this mechanism. When it came out two very thin square 
	washers were removed from behind it.
</p>

<p>
	The next photo shows all of the parts at this stage of disassembly. All of the 
	smaller parts are in plastic bags. The bags were labeled after this photo was taken. 
	The parts are packaged by subassembly.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope parts.jpg" alt="All of the parts at this stage of disassembly" width="3318" height="2214">

<p>
	Three things need further disassembly: the coarse and fine adjust mechanisms and the 
	diaphragm. The coarse knobs are held on by screws that use a two pin key. This needs 
	to be made. A new pawl needs to be made.
</p>

<p>
	The pin wrench will be made from a scrap of 1/4" brass. The brass scrap is half a 
	disk from 1&nbsp;1/4" round stock. The flat end was milled smooth. The two pins need 
	to be about 3/8" apart. The stock was marked at 7/16" from the edge and centered on 
	the 0.225" thick part. A number of drills were inserted into the holes. The holes 
	are approximately 0.054" in diameter. I have a broken drill that is 0.046" in 
	diameter. It is too wobbly in the hole. 
</p>

<p>
	Decided to make two pins. A length of 1/16" steel was held in the chuck with about 
	1/4" protruding. The tip was reduced to 0.05" in one 0.005" pass. There was a lot of 
	chatter, but the tip was cut for a length of 3/32". The end was cut off at about 
	1/4" with a hacksaw. This was repeated to make the second shaft. The reduced ends fit 
	nicely within the holes. The piece of brass from above was drilled about 3/8" in from 
	one end and centered across the 0.225" width. The holes in the coarse adjustment 
	screw were measured. The outside measurement is 0.45" and the inside is 0.35". The 
	second hole was drilled 0.40" from the first. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope pins.jpg" alt="The pins and the handle of the pin screwdriver" width="1687" height="1247">

<p>
	A drop of Loctite red was put into each hole. The pins were put into place and aligned 
	with a straightedge. This Loctite sets in 20 minutes, but takes a day to fully cure.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope pin screwdriver.jpg" alt="The completed pin screwdriver" width="1895" height="1559">

<p>
	The pin screwdriver was put to use this morning. The pins were a fraction too far 
	apart. With a little work I was still able to use it to remove the screw cap from 
	the handle. The disassembled fine adjust handle is shown below. The opposite handle 
	could not be removed. There is a pin holding this screw cap in place. I don't want 
	to drill the pin out, so this handle won't be removed.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope pinned cap.jpg" alt="The handle that will not be removed" width="1445" height="1590">

<p>
	A second dovetail was still attached to the optical tube. Its three screws were 
	removed. It readily separated from the tube. This is shown in the first photo below. 
	The viewing tube also has a catch screwed to the lens selector. This was removed via 
	two small screws.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope second dovetail.jpg" alt="The second dovetail removed from the optical tube" width="1690" height="1659">
<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope catch.jpg" alt="The catch for positioning the viewing lens" width="1388" height="1799">

<p>
	The light admitting assembly has a half round lens. This is held into the frame with 
	a threaded ring. The ring has two "screwdriver" slots. The assembly was held in the 
	vise and two small screwdrivers were used to unscrew this ring. The bulge in the lens 
	points up through the retaining ring when assembled.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope light lens.jpg" alt="The light admitting lens removed from its housing" width="1638" height="1278">

<p>
	There is a simple sliding tube to adjust the light admitting lens. This tube has 
	two screws holding the lock. One was difficult to remove, but yielded to a jeweler's 
	screwdriver held in a pair of pliers, while holding the ring in the vise.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope lock off.jpg" alt="The light admitting slide lock removed" width="1309" height="1157">

<p>
	The final image of the disassembly is the sum total of parts. There are a few that 
	will not be taken apart, due to the difficulties involved. With luck things are 
	well enough documented here and the bag labels sufficiently clear that reassembly 
	will go as smoothly as disassembly.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope parts 2.jpg" alt="All of the parts that will be disassembled" width="3291" height="2246">

<p>
	The glass was cleaned first. The lens in the light admission assembly was cleaned 
	with Windex and a microfiber cloth. The other lenses were cleaned similarly. A 
	q-tip also came in handy. The black parts from the light admission assembly also 
	cleaned up nicely with the Windex. The blue filter glass was cleaned. It has a 
	shiny side and a matte side. A screw was cleaned on the Scotch wheel. Rust was 
	removed from a pivot with sandpaper.
</p>

<p>
	The pawl from the fine focus was measured. The steel is 0.103" thick. It varies from 
	0.455" to 0.080" wide. It is 1.041" long. The bearing that sits inside the pawl's 
	hole is 0.182" in diameter. In the first photo is is clear how thin the steel was 
	where it broke. The second view shows the slight bend in the pawl. I do not believe 
	this was on purpose. The bump on the end is 0.127" long and 0.095" high. The area 
	containing the hole is 0.235" wide and needs to be thicker. An estimate of the 
	distance between the tip of the bump and the center of the hole is 1.02". A crude 
	sketch is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope pawl closeup.jpg" alt="A closeup of the pawl needing replacement" width="895" height="1093">

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope pawl sketch.jpg" alt="A sketch of the pawl needing replacement" width="1641" height="1782">

<p class="note">
	Note: the distance from the tip to the flat is 1.04". The distance to the top of the 
	loop is 1.17".
</p>

<p>
	Making such a small part on the mill presents numerous holding challenges. Consequently, 
	the part will be cut out of the middle of a 4" length of steel. This provides holding 
	on both ends with straight edges. To this end a 4" length of 1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2" 
	hot rolled steel was cut off with a hacksaw. It was held in the vise on one end and 
	between a jack and a strap clamp on the other. One side was cleaned up with the two 
	flute cutter and the other side was cut in 0.005" passes reducing the thickness to 
	0.103" over 1&nbsp;1/4".  One edge was also milled clean. The photo below shows the 
	latter operation.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope pawl milling.jpg" alt="The holding setup for milling the pawl" width="1884" height="1242">

<p>
	With this completed the shape of the pawl was laid out on the milled area of the 
	steel. The center of the hole was transferred, center drilled and drilled with a 
	#13 drill. The bearing spins smoothly in this hole. The steel at the short end was 
	cut off with a hacksaw. Then the angled cut was made by hacksaw. Finally the other 
	waste end was removed. The part was filed to shape with a variety of files. The 
	photo below shows the finished pawl below the broken pawl. The new pawl was purposely 
	left a lot beefier around the hole.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope new pawl.jpg" alt="The new pawl below the old" width="1342" height="1306">

<p>
	A few of the rustier parts were selected to try out the Naval Jelly purchased 
	yesterday. These included the pivot screw and nut along with the lens selector and 
	associated screws from both. The rust remover was smeared on with the gloves being 
	worn. It was allowed to sit for ten minutes, the longest time recommended. The pink 
	jelly was washed off with cold water. There was some improvement, but not much. All 
	of these parts were placed in a jar of Evaporust, also purchased yesterday.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Naval Jelly is mostly phosphoric acid with small amounts of isopropanol and sulfuric 
	acid. The non-aqueous ingredients in Evaporust are trade secrets.
</p>

<p>
	The larger parts were just dirty. They were washed with soap and water. After drying 
	they looked brand new. These parts are all made of brass except the slide platform. 
	It may be made of hard rubber. The photo shows how well they all cleaned up.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope cleaned lg.jpg" alt="The large parts after soap and water" width="2000" height="2636">

<p class="note">
	I would like to know the source of the black paint used on these parts. It has 
	lasted for many years without scratching or marring. It may be japanning, a 
	hard black varnish containing asphalt.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually all of the parts were cleaned up via a combination of Evaporust and 
	sanding, sometimes up to 2000 grit. The first photo below shows all of the cleaned 
	and shiny parts. The remainder show the same, but with close-ups of certain 
	subassemblies.
</p>

<p>
	The assembly will proceed mostly in reverse order of the disassembly. The light 
	subassembly tube was held in the vise and given a bit of squeeze in order to attach 
	the clamp screw. The light admitting lens was placed in the slide holder and the 
	two slotted retaining ring was screwed into place holding it tight. The lens 
	assembly slid easily into the tube with a twisting motion.
</p>

<p>
	Assembling the viewing tube and its associated parts was next. The small selector 
	was screwed into position with two screws. Three screws affixed the dovetail.

	The coarse adjust mechanism was put together. White lithium grease purchased for 
	the South Bend lathe spindle cone was put inside the bearings and on the gear. The 
	knob/shaft was pushed through and the opposite knob slid onto the shaft. The pin
	screw was tightened to hold everything together.

<p>
	The next step is mounting this coarse adjustment mechanism on the image tube dovetail. 
	The rack is mounted between the two parts. I lost one of the thin square spacers. I 
	hope to get by without using them. The spacer I have is 0.005" thick. My lucky day! 
	I walked into the wood shop and immediately spotted the missing spacer lying on the 
	floor!
</p>

<p>
	A spot of grease was placed around each of the two screw holes in the viewing tube 
	dovetail. A thin brass spacer was placed over each hole. The rack was screwed into 
	place with only the top screw. This is the thinner headed screw in the deeply 
	countersunk hole. Grease was smeared over the length of the rack as shown below. 
	The adjusting mechanism's dovetail was oiled with 3-in-1 oil and slid up from the 
	bottom of the viewing tube to install. The rack's second screw was installed through 
	the provided hole in the adjusting mechanism. The assembly at this stage is shown 
	in the second photo below.

<p>
	The bottom plate and its stop screw were installed. The screws were oiled prior to 
	installation.

<p>
	The frame was assembled with the pivot screw. First, the four screws on the two 
	frame members were installed (probably for accessories). The steel bearing was oiled 
	on its ends and the upper frame was forced into the lower. The oiled pivot screw was 
	installed with its pin aligned with the provided hole. The pivot pin required a few 
	taps with a rubber mallet to seat. The two pin nut was installed on the opposite end 
	of the pivot screw.

<p>
	The fine adjust mechanism was installed next. After doing it the wrong way I realized 
	the longer set of two screws serve as set screws in the knobs, while the shorter 
	screwed the flange to the frame. Oil was applied to the internal screw and to the 
	individual screws. A small amount of grease was applied to the wheel. The flange 
	side knob was installed first, followed by the numbered knob on the opposite side.

<p>
	The pawl was the next installation challenge for my large clumsy fingers. Once I 
	determined the correct way to install it. the back side was greased as was the 
	bearing. I was unable to completely screw in the screw. The part around the bearing 
	is a little too beefy.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope too big pawl.jpg" alt="The pawl that is too large too fit" width="1510" height="1477">

<p>
	The pawl was removed and filed to a slightly smaller size. It was also thinned a bit. 
	After regreasing it was reinstalled. It is not a loose fit, but moves smoothly when 
	the knobs are turned. The next dovetail was attached to the viewing tube with two 
	screws. I was struggling to figure out how the fine focus works. The pin sticking 
	out on this last dovetail rides on the small flat at the top of the pawl. When I 
	installed the viewing tube on the frame by sliding it down it comes to a hard stop.
	This should be the pin resting on the pawl's flat. I am having a hard time 
	determining whether that is the case or if the pin is stopping short because the 
	pawl is larger on that side.
</p>

<p>
	Using the Brown & Sharpe height gauge I was unable to measure any displacement upon 
	turning the fine focus knob three or four full turns. I think this implies more pawl 
	filing is required to thin the area near the flat. This was the area in the original 
	pawl that was so thin it broke.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope measuring.jpg" alt="Using the height gauge to measure displacement" width="1892" height="2157">

<p>
	A few measurements later and the problem was revealed in all its ugly glory. The edge 
	of the screw holding the pawl in place is 0.073" from the center of the dovetail. 
	The pin is centered in the dovetail and is 0.142" in diameter. There is 0.002" to 
	spare for the pawl in that spot. They drilled the hole in the wrong place!
</p>

<p>
	I don't want to plug the hole and redrill it. That would be too difficult to get 
	an accurate location. The other option is to remove the pin and turn it down to a 
	narrower size or make a new one. The pin was removed and is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="microRst/Microscope pawl pin.jpg" alt="The pin that rides on the pawl" width="1381" height="2445">

<p>
	The pin was held in the three jaw chuck and reduced to 0.092". It is shown installed 
	below. The pawl was removed again and filed until the thickness in the offending 
	region is 0.032". It is also shown below after filing and after installation. After 
	installing the pawl the viewing tube was installed. The fine focus knobs moved the 
	tube as expected. The top plate was screwed into place (the second time with the 
	spring).

	steps are seen below.

	The light assembly was nearly the last item. The first and most challenging task 
	was putting the diaphragm together. It uses three of the tiniest screws I have ever 
	seen. (Two can barely be seen in the first of three photos below.) The first time I 
	assembled the three parts, the diaphragm was open, but turned to the wrong end of the 
	slot that constrains the lever. It was opened back up and the diaphragm rotated. 
	After reassembly the diaphragm opened, but it was not a round opening. I took the 
	assembly apart again. I played with the 'fins'. They were pretty tight, probably 
	because of the corrosion I did not know how to remove. I put a bit of oil on them 
	and the movement became much easier. I also aligned the fins. It was put together 
	for a third time (a screw was lost and found) successfully. This took over an hour. 
	I hate tiny screws!

<p>
	A long screw with a washer and a bearing went through the filter holder and into the 
	diaphragm assembly. The diaphragm assembly was screwed to the light admitting lens 
	tube. The inside of the sliding tube was oiled and the lens tube slid into place. 
	Three screws held this assembly to the underside of the specimen table. The table 
	was screwed to the frame with two screws. Two shots of the assembled light admitter 
	are shown below.

<p>
	The two specimen clips were inserted into the table. The eyepiece tube was screwed 
	to the top of the viewing tube. The 10X lens was slid into the eyepiece tube. The 
	microscope is ready for use, at least once I purchase a light source.
