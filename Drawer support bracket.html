	One of the large drawers in the pantry broke. The plastic bracket that holds the 
	back end of the runner on the pantry side broke. It was temporarily fixed using a 
	C-clamp to pinch the bracket around the U-shaped runner. A permanent fix was 
	called for. A few measurements were taken from a good plastic bracket and from 
	the runner. These led to the plan shown below. Essentially a U-shaped support will 
	project from a base. The base will have holes to screw to the back of the pantry 
	and the U-shaped support will have two screws to clamp the runner in place.
</p>

<p>
	The project began with a 1" X 2 3/8" X 2 1/2" block of aluminum. A square corner 
	was available and was used to mark out the general shape of the bracket. The 
	bracket was then rough cut with a hacksaw down all four sides to leave a 5/16" thick 
	base with a 3/4" X 1 1/4" X 2" projection. The part was held in the mill vise and 
	the base bottom was set perpendicular to the milling table.
</p>

<p>
	A narrow side of the projection was cut to the line using a 1/2" end mill. 0.020" 
	were removed per 0.25" wide pass of the end mill. The projecting end of the base was 
	thinned to 0.27" while the part was in the same setup. The bracket was flipped 
	over the base set perpendicular to the table, and the other narrow side was cut to 
	the line in a similar fashion and the projecting end of the base was cut to 0.27". 
	This left the two wide sides of the projection to cut.
</p>

<p>
	The narrow sides were remarked by holding the base against a 1-2-3 block. The 
	projection was mounted in the mill vise using a square to make sure the base was 
	vertical. The first side was cut as before with the 1/2" end mill. The part was 
	flipped over and set on parallels and the second wide side was cut leaving a 1/2" 
	thick projection.
</p>

<p>
	With the bracket still in the vise the end mill was used to cut the 0.375" slot. 
	A slot was cut with the 1/2" end mill to the base in 0.020" increments. This slot 
	was then enlarged by taking 0.020" cuts at full depth. The drawer support rail 
	was remeasured at 1.16" before cutting the slot to full width. This left the sides 
	of the slot about 0.10" thick.
</p>

<p>
	Four holes were drilled 1/4" in from the corners with a #10 drill to fit  
	#6 wood screws. Two holes were drilled and tapped 5-40 through the top side of the 
	slot at 1/4" and 7/8" centered across the width of the side wall. The plan was to 
	use these holes for screws to press down on the top of the drawer guide and hold 
	it in place.
</p>

<p>
	The old bracket was removed and the new bracket was placed on the end of the drawer 
	guide. The first problem became apparent. There was not sufficient room between the 
	end of the guide and the back wall of the cabinet to fit the new bracket. This is 
	due to both the thickness of the bracket back and to the large radius in the slot's 
	corners. Both issues were tackled. The back of the bracket was thinned by about 
	1/8" on the mill. The radii in the corners were reduced with a dremel burr. 
	Fixing this issue highlighted the second issue. The drawer guide is not a simple 
	U-shaped part, but also has a lip coming down from the lower lip. This is visible 
	just above the C-clamp's lower jaw in the picture above. Tightening the 5-40 screws 
	just pushed the guide down and out of the new bracket. Consequently the guide was 
	drilled and threaded for 5-40 screws and the bracket's 5-40 holes were opened up 
	to 0.152". The 1/4" screws on hand went into the guide about 1/16" and the wheel 
	on the drawer was impeded. The screws were shortened, the bracket fit nicely on the 
	end of the guide, and the wheel moved freely.
</p>

<p>
	With the bracket installed on the guide the guide was leveled. The distance to the 
	side wall was set to match front and back. Four 3/4" #6 wood screws were used to 
	fix the bracket to the back wall. The picture below shows the installed bracket. 
	The drawer slid in easily and opens and closes like a charm!! 
</p>

	Cross this off the honey-do list!
