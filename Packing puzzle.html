<p class=first>
	Saw a simple packing puzzle on Mr. Puzzle's Youtube channel. The puzzle he shows is 
	a box with a clear lid. The lid has a hole in it for adding six identical blocks. I 
	plan to mimic this puzzle. It will be made of aluminum with aluminum bars on the top 
	forming the opening. There are already puzzle pieces/blocks available from the 
	<a href="3-Piece puzzle.html">3-Piece Puzzle</a>.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PP Plan.png" alt="Box plan for the packing puzzle" width="574" height="364">

<p>
	The blocks are 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1", so the box interior will be 
	1.562"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2.062". (A little play for imperfect blocks.) A length of 1" 
	aluminum angle will be cut providing 1" wide box sides. A thin sheet of aluminum 
	will be used as the bottom. The four strips comprising the top will be made from 
	the cutoffs of the aluminum angle using a jig.
</p>

<p>
	The first challenge is cutting the aluminum angle at the vertex to provide the 1" 
	wide strip of 1/8" aluminum. This went better than expected, but realized the bar 
	was a little too short for all four sides. So focus was shifted to a bar of 
	3/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/4" aluminum.
</p>

<p>
	Four sides were cut from this bar. Pairs were aligned in the milling vise and milled 
	flush on one side. The pair was flipped over and milled to length: 1.562" for the 
	short sides and 2.438" for the long sides.
</p>

<p>
	The long sides were marked for holes at 1/2" and 1/4" centered 3/32" from the edges. 
	These holes were drilled through, 0.070", for 0-80 screws. The holes were transferred 
	to the edges of the short sides using the same drill bit on two sides clamped 
	together as shown below. While drilling the first hole the bit broke off in the 
	aluminum. On this part the holes were remarked with the opposite side serving as 
	bottom. Holes were drilled for 2-56 screws and tapped about 1/4" deep. The holes 
	in the long sides were opened up further to accomodate the larger screw size. The 
	assembled sides are shown below. The box is square unlike the picture.
</p>

<p>
	Decided to try a plastic window. A piece of 3/16" plastic was cut to fit the 
	aluminum box, 1.563&nbsp;X&nbsp;2.063". A 1" square was marked out in the middle of 
	this piece of plastic. Two opposite corners were drilled with a 1/8" drill 1/16" from 
	both sides. The coping saw blade did not fit through the 1/8" hole as the end pegs 
	were too long. The holes were opened with a #27 drill (0.144"). The square opening 
	was cut out using an aluminum strip to maintain some degree of straightness. The 
	hole's sides were then filed to make them straight. Finally, two-part epoxy was used 
	to glue the plastic lid into the top of the box.

<p class="note">
	The aluminum was not a good choice as a straightedge. It is so soft that cutting into 
	it with the coping saw was not noticeable.
</p>

<p>
	The glue was allowed go dry for over 24 hours. The box was sanded with 320 grit paper. 
	It is not too bad looking for a quick project. There was some glue squeeze out, but 
	it is not too distracting.
</p>

<p>
	A large piece of 1/16" aluminum plate was found. A corner was painted with Dykem and 
	marked around the box. The plate was cut with the table saw using the cross slide. 
	The plate held beneath the box looked good with the Dykem, so it was painted more 
	uniformly. In order to miss the screws holding the box together, the bottom was 
	drilled for through holes in the middle of the sides, 3/32" in from the edges. The 
	holes were transferred to the box edges with a punch. These four holes were center 
	drilled, drilled (#50), and tapped 2-56. Four screws were shortened to tightly hold 
	the bottom in place. The photos below show the drilled bottom and the completed box.

	The next picture shows my lack of progress in solving the packing puzzle. And a few 
	minutes later success!

<p>
	Decided to make a box to contain the box and pieces separately. The box was based on 
	an article in Home Shop Machinist Vol 41, No. 1, 2022. A long scrap of 1/4" poplar 
	and a scrap of 3/4" baltic birch plywood were discovered. The 3/4" plywood was cut 
	to 2&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;4&nbsp;1/2". The poplar was cut to 2&nbsp;1/2" width and 
	into two 5" lengths and two 3" lengths. One 3" length was shortened from 2&nbsp;1/2" 
	to 2&nbsp;1/4". The two long lengths were slotted with the table saw 1/8" from an 
	edge and stopping prior to the end. This stopped slot was finished with a 1/8" 
	end mill to 1/8" from the end. The longer end part was slotted 1/8" all along one 
	edge. The slots on three sides will serve as a dado for a sliding lid.
</p>

<p>
	The 3/4" plywood bottom had two pockets milled into it. They were 1/2" apart leaving 
	1/4" at either end. The large pocket is 2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2&nbsp;1/2" and the small 
	pocket is 1&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2". The large pocket was milled 5/8" deep and the 
	small pocket was milled 1/4" deep. The completed pockets are shown below. The screw 
	heads on the puzzle box did not quite fit, so a chisel was used to provide room for 
	the screws. The corners were also squared up. The second photo shows these chisel 
	modifications.
</p>

<p>
	The sides were sanded and a few repairs were made. The sides were glued to the box's 
	bottom. No screws were used as there is little room for them in the bottom. The 
	photo below shows the glued and clamped container.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/PP container clamped.jpg" alt="The bottom of the container containing the puzzle parts" width="1727" height="1656">

<p>
	The container was sanded on the outside as seen below. The top was made from a 1/2" 
	length of red oak. The oak was cut to the measured width, 3&nbsp;5/16". A 4&nbsp;15/16" 
	length was cut from this board. The table saw blade was set to 3/8". Two long sides 
	were cut just to the width of the blade. The larger of the short sides was cut the 
	same way leaving rails on three sides. The top slid in cleanly, except for the last 
	1/8". The plugs from closing dadoes were in the way. The corners of the rails were 
	cut back 1/8" with a chisel. The top was then heavily chamfered with a plane on the 
	long sides and with a rasp on the ends. The chamfer is 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/4" on all 
	four sides. The lid and box were taped and spray painted ivory. Below are two shots 
	of the finished container with some felt glued into the cutouts.
