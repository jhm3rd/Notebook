<p class=first>
	I took a class on building a Machinist's Tool Chest taught by Doug Dale at 
	<a href="marcadams.com">Marc Adam's School of Woodworking</a>. Plans were provided 
	as well as detailed instructions. Doug and the assistants set up all of the saws, 
	routers, and drill presses with jigs and accurate measurements to make all of the 
	parts. We were led through the assembly process and left with a completed box and 
	drawer set after a solid week's work.

<p>
	A few repairs were needed before finishing. Two of the corners had some chip out and 
	the hole for the front face pull was drilled on the wrong side. Small pieces of wood 
	were cut to fit (oversize) the damaged areas glued in place and . These were then 
	sanded down to match the surfaces of the box. A plug was made from oak in the lathe 
	to fit the mis-drilled hole. After gluing in place the plug was sanded flat to the 
	surface of the box front. The other side of the front was then drilled to fit the 
	pull. The box, lid, front, and drawer fronts were sanded to 150 grit and stained 
	with golden mahogany stain. The parts were then painted with four thin coats of 
	shellac, sanding lightly between coats with 150 grit paper.

	Some of the hardware was then installed. The side handles just needed to be screwed 
	into place. Hinges were set about 4" in from the sides. A transfer punch was used to 
	mark the top and the front for the locking pins. The front was drilled 9/64" and the 
	front rail holes were opened to 9/64" as well. The top was drilled about 1/16" deep 
	with a 3/8" drill. The locking pin hardware was installed per the included 
	instructions. The lock was installed followed by pressing the knobs into the drawer 
	fronts.
</p>

<p>
	1.5 yards of green felt was purchased at Jo-Ann's Fabric. It was cut to fit the 
	drawer, top and lid bottoms using both a razor in the corners of the box and scissors. 
	Some minor cutting was needed to fit the felt in the 
	bottoms. Hide glue was spread with a silicone brush in the bottoms and the felt was 
	pressed into place. A small wooden block was used to press the felt into the corners 
	as well as making sure it was pressed down all across the bottom of the boxes. Two 
	long strip of 2" and 1" felt was cut for covering the sides of the top and the lid, 
	respectively. This was put in place and further trimmed to accurately fit the sides. 
	The sides were painted with hide glue and the felt pressed in place as before. This 
	required very exacting work to get it to look nice.

	All that remained was adding the corner protectors and the front pull. I was 
	concerned that I might drill too deeply when adding the corner protectors, so I made 
	a drill stop for a 5/64" drill. Drill rod was placed in the chuck, faced, chamfered, 
	and drilled with a #47 drill (about 0.001" larger then 5/64") to a depth of 0.30". I 
	was unable to part this off at 0.25" so it was cut off with a hacksaw and then faced 
	and chamfered. This tube was then cross drilled and tapped 6-32. I only had a starting 
	tap and a broken tap in this size. The starting tap only cut a few threads before 
	bottoming out. The broken tap was ground flat and then a slight angle was ground on 
	each of the three flutes. This did the trick and finished the threads all the way 
	through the hole. A 6-32 set screw was inserted to complete the stop. All of the 
	corner protectors were installed without difficulty.

	The screws for the front pull were quite small requiring a #55 drill. The cordless 
	drill cannot hold drills this small. I pulled out the old hand crank drill and it 
	was capable of holding drills this small. The holes for the pull were marked and 
	drilled. The screws were installed completing a beautiful chest.

<p>
	A plaque for the chest was prepared. A 1 7/8" X 3" sheet of 1/16" brass was cut with 
	a hacksaw. It was squared up in the mill after clamping across a 1-2-3 block and held 
	against a 1-2-3 block in the vise square to the part's one good side. The faces and 
	sides were then sanded smooth with successively 220, 320, 600, 1000, and 1500 grit 
	paper.
