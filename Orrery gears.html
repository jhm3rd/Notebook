<p class=first>
	The earth gears both need 39 teeth. The purchased #3 (35-54) gear cutter was used.
	(DP = 30: PA = 14.5&deg;)  
	The process began with two brass blanks, 1/4" X 1.5" X 1.625". The center was 
	marked on both blanks, drilled to the C drill bit and reamed with a 1/4" reamer. 
	Both blanks were placed on the arbor back to back. Their diameter was reduced to 
	1.367". The arbor with the blanks still affixed was moved to the Sherline gear 
	cutting head via the 3-jaw chuck. The cutter was touched to the top of the blank 
	and lowered 0.110" followed by an additional drop of 0.684" to center it relative 
	to the blank. The teeth were cut in increments of 0.010" except for the last three 
	cuts at depths of 0.065", 0.070" and 0.072". The teeth were cleaned up with a few 
	light touches with a 3-corner needle file. The edges were slightly chamfered with 
	a file in the lathe.
</p>

<p class=note>
	This required about six minutes per tooth!! The #2, #3, #4, & #7 cutters 
	were purchased from RDG Tools UK.
</p>

<p>
	The 27 tooth Mars gear was prepared next. A square of 1/4" thick brass was reduced 
	on the lathe to 0.967" after reaming the center hole to 1/4" and placing the blank 
	on the arbor. The chuck was moved to the indexing attachment and 27 teeth were cut 
	with the #3 cutter!!! Wrong cutter, but the fit was fine! May redo this gear at some 
	point.
</p>

<p>
	Next up was the 48 tooth Venus driver gear. A 1/4" X 2" X 2" brass bar was cut to a 
	1 3/4" square with the hacksaw. This was drilled (C) and reamed on center to 1/4". 
	It was placed on the arbor in the 3-jaw chuck and reduced to 1.667". The chuck was 
	moved to the indexing attachment and the #3 cutter was centered vertically on the 
	blank. The cutting depth was increased with cuts at 0.020", 0.035", 0.050", 0.060", 
	0.070", and 0.072". Cutting speed was about 760 rpm. The gear was transferred back 
	to the lathe and deburred with light touches of the 3-corner needle file.
</p>

<p class=note>
	The Venus gear had to be remade. (2/2/18) There were a number of spots that continued 
	to catch even after significant filing. The new gear worked smoothly without any 
	modification. The new Sherline Dividing Head Calculator was used to determine the 
	offsets for making the cuts.
</p>

<p>
	The 51 tooth Mars gear was made similarly to the Venus gear above, except it began 
	with a 2" square of 1/4" brass and reduced to 1.767" after reaming the 1/4" hole in 
	the center. After cutting the 51 teeth it was cleaned up a bit with 150-grit 
	sandpaper. The Venus 30 teeth gear was made from a 1.25" square of 1/4" brass and 
	reduced on the arbor to 1.067". The 30 teeth were cut with the #4 cutter. 
</p>

<p>
	The Mercury 15 teeth gear needs an arbor with a smaller back support (~0.45") and 
	positions the gear further from the chuck to avoid interference with the cutter. This 
	arbor was made from a 2 1/4" length of 1/2" steel round bar. It was faced and center 
	drilled on one end and this end was reduced to 0.375" for a length of 1.5". The bar 
	was flipped end-for-end in the chuck and the opposite end was faced and center 
	drilled. The bar was reduced to 0.450" for the remaining 3/4". 1/2" was further 
	reduced to 0.249". A 1/4" length was threaded after chamfering 1/4-28. A short spacer 
	was made to move the nut farther from the blank. A nut was made from a 3/8" piece of 
	steel hex by drilling and tapping 1/4-28. With the arbor in hand a 5/16" thick slice 
	of 3/4" brass was drilled and reamed 1/4". It was reduced to 0.567" and both sides 
	were chamfered. The 15 teeth were cut with the #7 cutter. The 63 teeth Mercury gear 
	was made similarly to those above after more brass was purchased. All of the gears 
	worked well except for the Mercury pair where there was some binding in a particular 
	spot on the large gear. These few teeth were filed until the fit was acceptable.
