	Daniel requested I make a bottle cap for his water bottle. He has a nice aluminum 
	bottle, but the cap is plastic and wore out long before the bottle. The cap is an 
	interesting design that will require a lot of hand work to complete. (At some point 
	Rhea also requested one for her bottle and an additional cap was made.) The plan and 
	the completed prototype cap are the only things I have available for this write up 
	seven years later.

<p>
	A 2.25" length of 1.25" aluminum was cut off with a hacksaw. One end was faced and 
	the part flipped in the three jaw chuck. This end was faced and 1.09" was reduced to 
	1.0". The part was single point threaded 1-14. The threads were stopped about 1/16" 
	from the shoulder to leave room for the rubber gasket.
</p>

<p>
	This reduced length was held horizontally in the mill vise. The spindle was centered 
	over the aluminum shaft. It was drilled up to 23/32" for the finger hole. The part 
	was rotated 90&deg; on its axis. A 3/8" end mill was used to mill in from the end
	on both sides. The eventual shape was milled in 0.91" from the end and 0.45" from 
	the side.
</p>

<p>
	The part was moved to the three jaw chuck and a 7&deg; taper was cut on the drilled 
	and milled end. The threaded end was cut off 0.66" from the shoulder. Back in the 
	milling vise three grooves were milled through the threads with a 1/8" end mill to 
	a depth of 1/16". These threads let the air out when the cap is screwed in place.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of care was taken to round off all of the corners especially in the finger 
	hole. The final product was sanded up to 220 grit. A gasket was made from a sheet 
	of 1/16" thick rubber. The dimensions were ID = 1" & OD = 1.25".
</p>

<p>
	The only picture I have is of the first one, that did not turn out that well. It is 
	shown below.
