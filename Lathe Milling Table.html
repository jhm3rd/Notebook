<p class=first>
	I purchased a milling attachment for the South Bend lathe at NAMES, but decided to 
	also make a very simple plate for the cross slide to serve for simple milling 
	operations. It consists of three parts: the table, an optional riser block, and the 
	button to attach to the cross slide. The original author's picture of the upside 
	down table is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Milling Table.jpeg" alt="Milling Table" width="1004" height="562">

<p class=note>
	This idea and plans are from a contribution to bbs.homeshopmachinist.net. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Milling Table Plans.jpeg" alt="Milling Table Plans" width="1296" height="670">

<p>
	The table was the first part to be tackled. A 3/4" X 6" X 10" CRS plate was ordered 
	and used as is. The hole centers were laid out with the fixed marking out blocks, 
	1,2,3-blocks and a 1/2" bar of steel. I accidentally drilled too many holes in one 
	quadrant; forgetting that only every other intersection was to be drilled. The other 
	three quadrants of the plate were drilled according to plan. The hole centers were 
	punched and then drilled a few sixteenth's deep with a 9/64" drill bit. The hole was 
	then drilled through and opened to 5/16" with a succession of three drill bits. The 
	drill press in the garage was used for all drilling and did surprisingly well. 
	Drilling took about 8 hours! The burrs on the bottom of the plate were removed with 
	a file. All edges were also chamfered with the file. Tapping 3/8-16 then proceeded 
	smoothly with a taper tap. The only challenge was securely clamping such a large 
	plate to the workbench supported on 1/2" steel bars.
</p>

<p class=note>
	Took about an hour to clean up all of the drilling swarf! Maybe next time I will 
	find a better way to contain the chips close to the drill press. 
</p>

<p>
	Cut off a 1" length of 1 7/16" steel round bar with the bandsaw. Chucked it in the 
	South Bend and faced both ends. Moved to the Sherline and reduced 0.5" to 0.373". 
	Realized at this point that a cutter with a <60&deg; angle on the front was required 
	for cutting the miter. Will need to make one prior to proceeding. 
</p>

<p>
	Made a 55&deg; included angle lathe tool per the instructions in DevonThink/
	Metalworking Projects/grinding lathe tools from Sherline. First one side of the 
	tool was ground to a 10&deg; angle with the table set at 7&deg;. This was ground 
	until the length of the cutting edge was about 1/4". Second, the opposite side was 
	ground such that the included angle was 55&deg;. Third, the top of the tool was 
	pushed into the edge of the wheel and the tool was then rotated until the cutting 
	tip just touched the wheel producing top rake (relief?). Finally, the point was 
	'broken' by setting the bottom of the point against the wheel and rotating until 
	the tip of the point just touched the wheel leaving a small flat on the tip. Now 
	I am ready to cut the taper on the mount.
</p>

<p>
	Made the mount per the plans above. A 1" length of 1 5/16" steel rod was cut off in 
	the bandsaw. This was faced on both sides and then one end was reduced to 1.374" for 
	a length of > 0.5". Marks were made at the 0.100 and 0.400 points. The headstock was 
	rotated 30&deg; (Mark on headstock was accurate as measured by protractor.) and the 
	new tool was used to cut the 30&deg; taper. I then marked for the four screws and 
	drilled them through with a 7/32" drill bit and countersunk with a 5/16" drill bit 
	to a depth of 3/16". These holes were used to mark out three holes on the plate after 
	using the first to hold the parts together. The holes in the plate were drilled with 
	a #21 drill bit and tapped 10-32.
</p>

<p class=note>
	Countersinks were drilled on the wrong side of the mount as the drawing was 
	misunderstood!! Oh, well, making the mount in the lathe was rewarding. Need to 
	learn how to use the taper attachment on the South Bend for future taper work.
</p>

<p>
	The construction of the mount was repeated, but the countersinking was done on the 
	correct side of the mount this time. The holes were marked out using the holes 
	already drilled in the plate. After completion screws would only fit in three holes 
	at a time!! Either marked out wrong, unlikely, or one of the holes was not drilled 
	correctly. I need to use the new center drill bits purchased to start holes.
</p>

<p>
	I will use this milling table a few times before deciding whether to add the other 
	two sets of mounting holes in the plate and whether to make the accessory plate riser.
