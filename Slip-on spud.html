<p class=first>
	The latest issue of Machinist's Workshop (Vol. 35, No. 1, pg. 20) had an article 
	that caught my interest. It suggested a solution to a problem I routinely face, 
	aligning the drill with a punch mark. The solution is called a slip-on spud. It is 
	essentially a point that slips over a spotting drill for spindle alignment. 
</p>

<p>
	The instructions in the article were quite detailed and focused on ensuring 
	concentricity with the bore and the point. A 2" length of 3/8" steel hex was cut 
	from a long bar. It was faced on both ends to a final length of 1.75" One end was 
	chamfered and drilled. The hole was started with a spot drill and then drilled 
	with a 15/64" drill to a depth of 1&nbsp;1/8". It was drilled in 1/4" increments to 
	ensure chip build-up did not push the drill off line. The hole was then reamed to 
	1/4". It was a nice slip fit on the spotting drill.
</p>

<p>
	A mandrel was made to hold the spud. A 2" length of the same bar stock was reduced 
	to 0.250" for 1&nbsp;1/8". It was reduced in 1/4" increments to minimize flexing 
	during cutting. This was going well until at some point the part came loose in the 
	chuck! Alignment was not quite the same for the last 1/2". Miraculously the spud 
	fit reasonably well over the mandrel. I tapped it with a hammer to make sure it 
	would not come off. 
</p>

<p>
	The point was cut next. A quarter of an inch of the spud was reduced to 1/8" diameter. 
	The headstock was rotated 10&deg; and the point was cut in 0.005" increments. The 
	headstock was returned to center and the next 0.25" was reduced to 0.125". The 
	corner was chamfered.
</p>

<p>
	One thing the article neglected to mention was how to remove the mandrel from the 
	spud. I was unable to twist it off using a vise and a wrench. I also tried pulling 
	with vise grips while twisting the spud back and forth. I was able to twist it 
	about 1/4 turn total. A hammer and punch was also tried to separate the two parts 
	to no avail. I decided to drill the mandrel out.
</p>

<p>
	The part was returned to the chuck with the mandrel end sticking out. The mandrel 
	end was faced and drilled with a 15/64" drill. I stopped short of full depth. The 
	mandrel readily broke off at the attachment point. The drill was switched for the 
	1/4" reamer. After running the reamer in most of the waste readily came out. The 
	reamer was not perfectly centered as judged by the waste. The last bit of the 
	mandrel was carefully drilled and dropped out.
</p>

<p>
	Remarkably, the spud was still a decent fit on the spotting drill. At least 
	sufficient for my needs. The sides of the spud were sanded up to 600 grit to remove 
	most of the dents left by the vise-grip pliers. The picture below shows the slip-on 
	spud next to the spotting drill. The spud will be stored in a slip tube used for a 
	3/8" end mill.
