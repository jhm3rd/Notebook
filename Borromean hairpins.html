<p class=first>
	An artist making very interesting mathematically inspired toys is selling printed 
	plastic versions. One that struck me as doable with a mill is called 
	<a href="https://www.shapeways.com/product/WJ8788PQ4/borromean-hairpins?optionId=41230001&amp;li=shops">Borromean Hairpins</a>. 
	A photo from his website on ShapeWays is seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Borromean hairpins.jpg" alt="Borromean hairpins" width="710" height="528">

<p>
	Based on the photographs and video, the following assumptions can be made. The teeth 
	are cut at a 45&deg; angle. The pairs of legs are not symmetrical The teeth on the 
	inner face are flipped. There are racks are on three sides of the bars. The racks on 
	opposite faces are oriented the same direction and the teeth are aligned with one 
	another. A tooth on the middle face runs from the end of a tooth on one side to the 
	end of a tooth on the other side. These teeth align with the gaps between teeth on 
	the sides. The two legs of a pair are mirror images and I can find no series of 
	transformations that will overlay one leg of a pair with the other. The pins are 
	chiral. The diagram below shows the three splayed faces on opposing legs of a pair.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Cut orientation.png" alt="Cutting orientation for paired legs" width="698" height="614">

<p>
	In thinking through the manufacture of the bars a few important considerations came 
	to mind. The racks can be cut on individual bars or on groups of bars. If the latter 
	is done, the ends of the bars will not be identical. Either the bars need to be 
	shifted or the ends need to be cut to match afterwards. Alternatively, each bar can 
	be made independently. Since these bars will be made from 1/2" walnut, some provision 
	needs to be made to avoid tearout. The bars can be joined in pairs with a simple 
	block using glue and screws. The ends of the grooves will need to be chamfered so 
	entrance of mating teeth is smooth.
</p>

<p>
	The final product will be made with bars that are 5-6" long. Before tackling these 
	I plan to make three 3" bars. This will allow me to validate the assumptions made 
	above. Three 3" long blocks of 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2" walnut were prepared from 
	staff scrap. The teeth will be 0.115" wide and the grooves, made by an end mill, 
	will be 0.125" wide. I don't know if this is sufficient leeway, but guess it will 
	be okay. The depth of cut between teeth will be 0.094". The racks on these three 
	bars will be cut individually, so I will set up a stop.
</p>

<p>
	Cut two 3" long blocks this morning. The vise was set to 45&deg; precisely with a 
	dial gauge. The first block was wrapped in painter's tape and clamped on parallels. 
	The corner was found with a 1/4" rod in the chuck. The rod was swapped for a 1/8" 
	end mill. The part was shifted 0.303" (3/16" + 0.115"). The first cut was made and 
	the part was shifted another 0.240". Ten cuts were made each shifted 0.240" from the 
	previous cut. The second block was placed in the vise as before. This part was to 
	become the opposite side of a pair, so the cuts needed to be 90&deg; relative to the 
	cuts on the first part. So instead of using the x-feed to align and shift, the y-feed 
	was used. In this instance only nine cuts could be made as the part and vise were 
	pressed against the column before the entire shift could be made. (This will be a 
	real problem with the 5-6" bars.) The picture below shows the second part in the 
	vise.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Rack cut.jpg" alt="A rack in the vise" width="1176" height="1250">

<p>
	The cuts were all a little rough. A little cleaning with a needle file left smooth
	teeth and grooves. When the two parts were engaged they were a tight, but sliding 
	fit. The teeth need to made a little narrower for an easier fit. The teeth probably 
	do not need to be cut so deep either. I am guessing 0.020-0.025" difference between 
	teeth and groove and 1/16" depth of cut. The picture below shows the two parts 
	engaged.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Racks engaged.jpg" alt="Two 3" racks engaged" width="1551" height="784">

<p class="note">
	Playing with the two racks highlighted a second problem. The two racks when put 
	together were not aligned. They were a few degrees off as can be easily seen in 
	the photo below. My method for aligning the vise must be faulty!
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Racks misaligned.jpg" alt="Two 3" racks engaged but not aligned" width="1172" height="963">

<p>
	The cutting was adjusted this time to make the changes mentioned above. The vise was 
	aligned using a dial test indicator. The indicator showed the vise was off about 
	0.011" over a distance of 0.150". This was corrected. After touching off, the part 
	was shifted 0.288" and the shifts between cuts was reduced to 0.225". The depth of cut 
	was also reduced to 0.062". This produced a much worse cut. There was significantly 
	more tearout and very rough grooves. One direction was worse than the other. This can 
	be seen in the photo of the two racks. After cleaning up the racks move easily and 
	there is little excess slop. The two racks when pressed together were well aligned.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Racks second attempt.jpg" alt="Two 3" racks cut a second time" width="1088" height="1377">

<p>
	The plan is to return to cutting 3/32" deep grooves as these were cleaner. There are 
	two challenges that remain to be overcome. I need to be able to set up the wood so 
	all cuts on a side can be made with one setup. Right now even a 3" long rack is 
	difficult to cut without it running into the column. The second challenge is aligning 
	the cuts on all three sides and relative to one another. Relative to one another can 
	be finessed by trimming the ends of the rack as needed. But cutting all three sides 
	correctly will be difficult.
</p>

<p>
	A possible alternative to the mill would be the table saw. A box joint like jig 
	would be used for cutting the spaced grooves. Appropriately sized shims might work 
	to ensure that all three sides are cut with the correct alignment. A second possibility 
	is making a jig for the milling table that holds a rack and forces it to slide at a 
	45&deg; angle. 
</p>

<p>
	This jig will consist of four parts. Two parallel sides will have a groove cut into 
	one edge and two holes through each. These will be the guides. They will sit at 
	45&deg; angles relative to the table. The other two parts will make up the sliding 
	clamp. They will have ends cut at 45&deg; and screws near their ends to pull the 
	two pieces tight against the rack sitting between them. This sliding clamp will be 
	pushed under the end mill at the 45&deg; angle by hand.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Borro jig plan.png" alt="Plan for rack cutting jig" width="1338" height="1008">

<p>
	As I looked at the jig plan it seemed more complex than needed. The biggest simplification 
	is replacing the tongue with a lip. The guides can just use a notch to trap the lip 
	on the sliding clamps. Essentially the table becomes the bottom of the slot. The jig 
	only needs to slide about 3/4". I found a length of 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" aluminum bar 
	with tapped holes drilled into one edge. They are tapped 8-32. These will be ideal 
	for clamping a bar. I will attach a second piece of 1/4" on top of this to clamp the 
	rack in place. A 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/2" aluminum bar will be cut into 3/4" 
	wide guides.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Rack jig metal.jpg" alt="Scrap aluminum for the rack jig" width="1753" height="1355">

<p>
	The 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/2" bar was cut in half lengthwise to make 2 3&nbsp;1/2" 
	long bars. (Cut from both ends with the hacksaw and the cuts met in the middle!)
	These were placed together in the mill vise with the two cut surfaces up. 
	They were trimmed flat. The ends were then squared up as well. Rabbets were cut along 
	the long sides 1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/8". The T-slots in the milling table are 1&nbsp;1/2" 
	apart. So the holes in the guides that will be clamped at 45&deg; need to be 2.121" 
	apart. They were marked and drilled 7/32" or clearance for the 10-32 screws.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Rack jig guides.jpg" alt="Two guides for the rack jig" width="1360" height="970">

<p>
	The bottoms of the slide clamps were made next. The aluminum bar with holes had two 
	6" angled lengths cut from it with a hacksaw. I realized that the DTI cannot be 
	used for aligning the vise as I have no way of ensuring it is aligned perpendicular 
	to the vise. So the adjustable square was used to set the vise at 45&deg;. The two 
	lengths were held in the vise on parallels with a bit of paper between them and the 
	vise to get a good grip on both. The ends opposite the end mill were clamped together 
	with a C-clamp. Both parts were cut until the 45&deg; angle was established. The 
	parts were flipped end for end and the second side was cut making sure the first ends 
	were aligned. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Sliding clamp bottoms.jpg" alt="Two sliding clamp bottoms being cut" width="1334" height="1588">

<p>
	The rabbet was then cut in each of the four ends with the vise in the same position. 
	The end mill was moved until it just touched the end of the sliding clamp. It was 
	raised and the table advanced 0.125". The headstock was lowered and the notch was 
	cut in 0.015" increments. This left a perfect 0.125" extension on the end of the 
	sliding clamp. The remaining ends were cut similarly making sure to keep the notches 
	on the same side.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Sliding clamp notches.jpg" alt="Two sliding clamp bottoms notched" width="1922" height="1436">

<p>
	The tops of the sliding clamps were made next. These needed to be slightly shorter 
	than the length of the short side of the sliding clamp bottoms, so they will slide 
	between the guides. The short side of the bottoms was measured at 5&nbsp;5/8". Two 
	tops were laid out on the second scrap of aluminum. They were cut with a hacksaw. 
	After placing them in the vise like the clamp bottoms they were cut to clean up the 
	ends and produce an accurate 45&deg; angle. The second side was also cleaned up and 
	then the length was reduced to just below 5&nbsp;5/8". (Difficult to measure!) All 
	of the ends were deburred. The six parts are shown in the picture below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Sliding clamp jig parts.jpg" alt="All six parts of the sliding clamp jig" width="2507" height="1142">

<p>
	Drilling and tapping holes in the bottom two parts to provide clamping action and 
	drilling screwing the tops to the bottoms are the final two steps before the jig 
	can be tried out. All of the through holes and tapped holes were made. After a mad 
	scramble for screws and tee nuts the jig was assembled. A block of wood was put in 
	and clamped. Ooops! Of course when the wood is added the jaws are moved apart and 
	the clamping holes align when the ends are no longer aligned. I need to find a more 
	flexible clamping arrangement.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Sliding clamp jig assembled.jpg" alt="Assembled sliding clamp jig" width="1920" height="1189">

<p>
	A 1/2" block was placed in the sliding clamp. A 3/16" transfer punch was inserted 
	in the through hole and used to mark the opposite side of the clamp. This side of 
	the clamp was then drilled and tapped for 8-32 screws. When two screws were installed 
	the block was held firmly, but the clamp was no longer flat and would not slide 
	under the guides. This was expected, but it was easy enough to try. I am no longer 
	certain a feasible clamping arrangement exists. 
</p>

<p>
	I decided to try the clamp out even with the challenges. It seemed possible to get 
	the clamp sufficiently tight to hold the wooden block and not buckle the slides. Of 
	course when I put the milling extension in place and turned on the mill the end mill 
	described a nice circle! The extension's threads were not concentric with the 
	1/4" shaft held in the collet. So I made another. A 1&nbsp;1/2" length of 3/4" 
	aluminum hex was faced. 3/4" was reduced to 0.250" to fit smoothly in the collet. A 
	flat was filed on this 1/4" shaft for the set screw in the collet. Holding this in 
	the collet and attaching it to the lathe spindle guaranteed concentricity. 5/8" was 
	reduced to 3/4". This end was drilled about 5/8" deep and reamed 3/8". Threads were 
	cut to produce a 3/4-16 screw. Theoretical thread depth was 0.047", but 0.044" was a 
	nice fit in the 3/8" end mill collet. After a bit of cleanup the adapter was put to 
	use. The end mill ran true as expected. Unfortunately, the wooden block moved sideways 
	during milling a 3/32" deep groove with the 1/8" end mill. I need better clamping 
	action!
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Milling collet extender.jpg" alt="Completed milling collet extender" width="1865" height="1015">

<p>
	Before I make any modifications to the sliding clamp, sandpaper or double sided tape 
	need to be tried. Both will make it difficult for the wooden block to slide sideways 
	during milling. But will they make it difficult enough? Didn't work used the tape to 
	hold sand paper in place. When the clamp was tightened, it buckled enough to prevent 
	sliding! I may give up on the sliding clamp and attempt cutting the grooves on the 
	South Bend lathe. But that will have to await warmer weather.
</p>

<p>
	After thinking through the challenges I have decide to give the table saw a try. A 
	jig is required. The jig will be quite similar to a box joint jig with a pin to hold 
	the last cut in place for the next cut. The jig needs to be solid to avoid flexing. A 
	3" piece of 3/4" red oak was cut to 15". (The jig was first tried with plywood, but 
	cutting the openings tore the wood up so badly that the jig was ruined.) After 
	setting the blade to 0.094" and the miter gauge very carefully to 45&deg; (equal legs 
	on a framing square) the jig was aligned with the right edge of the miter gauge fence. 
	The board was clamped in place. A cut was made. The board was moved back so that it 
	was 0.318" farther than the end of the miter gauge fence. This was done with gauge 
	blocks (0.118 & 0.200). Again the jig board was clamped and the cut made. The opposite 
	45&deg; angle was then set on the miter gauge and the same process was followed, but 
	the opposite end of the board was aligned. Two 'rectangles' were cut out of the jig 
	directly above the slots cut using a 7/8" Forstner bit and a chisel. The rectangles 
	were approximately 1"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2" and were 1/2" above the cut slots.
</p>

<p>
	A key was made from a scrap of 1/8" thick brass. This was thinned in the mill to 
	0.117" (was shooting for 0.120"). A strip was cut off about 1/8" wide. This was set 
	up in the vise using a ruler as a parallel with a drill added for increased height. 
	The width was reduced to 0.094". The resulting key is 
	0.094"&nbsp;X&nbsp;0.117"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1.5". Two holes were drilled and tapped 0-80:
	the first at 1/8" and the second at 1/2". The key was clamped in the key slot (the 
	second or outside cut in both sides) and one hole was drilled through to the 
	rectangular opening. This hole was opened to 0.070" and then a 1/2" 0-80 screw was 
	installed through the hole and into the key. The second hole was then drilled and 
	opened in the wood. This process was repeated on the other side. The photo shows the 
	jig completed, but the key with screws is just sitting the key slot. Not yet sure how 
	to index for cutting on the sides of the parts relative to the inner face.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Borro jig.jpg" alt="Jig for cutting slots with the table saw" width="1986" height="789">

<p>
	Here it is July of the next year and it is time to pick the hairpins up again. The 
	jig was assembled after locating the parts. A 27"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/2" 
	piece of walnut was also discovered. The blade height was initially set at 3/32". 
	This proved too shallow as the pin was taller due to things not sitting perfectly 
	flat on the table. The blade was raised to the height of the pin. The jig was setup 
	to cut the hairpin's right face. The end of the walnut was placed against the key 
	and the first cut was made. This cut was placed over the key and a second cut was 
	made. Care was taken to make sure the board was snug to the fence on each cut. 
	Repeat an untold number of times and the walnut was multiply slitted. There was no 
	tearout, except for the first tooth. The slots are 0.108" deep, slightly deeper 
	than planned.
</p>

<img class=inline src="borHair/Borro jig cut.jpg" alt="Jigs first use cutting multiple slots" width="1935" height="2119">

<p>
	The next challenge is how to cut the slots on the left side and assure the right 
	and left sides are correctly aligned. The first attempt is to switch the jig to 
	cutting the left side and repeat the above process. As can be seen in the photo 
	below this leaves the teeth about 1/16" off. Essentially a 1/16" needs to be 
	removed from the end on the first cut moving the cut 1/16" deeper into the wood
	(or 0.065" by measuring with calipers).
