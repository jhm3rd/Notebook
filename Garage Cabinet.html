<p class=first>
	The cabinet was needed for extra lathe accessory storage and to increase the amount 
	of workbench space in the garage. It was designed to sit at the left side of the 
	lathe so it needed to be lower than the door covering the change gears. 34" was 
	selected for the total height. There is about 30" or so space between the lathe and 
	the shelves, so 27" was chosen for the length. The depth was set at 24".
</p>

<p>
	The cabinet was designed to hold accessories in an enclosed space and to hold bar 
	stock in an open area. The design also called for three shelves, one on the bottom 
	and two above. Lap joint construction with 2 X 4s was selected for sturdiness. The 
	top and the shelves were 3/4" thick plywood for the same reason. The cabinet was 
	designed with a door so the shelves were completely enclosed to keep out dust and 
	chips. Additionally, anti-rust mats were to be used on the enclosed shelves.
</p>

<p class=note>There were no plans <em>per se</em> beyond a few sketches.
</p>

<p>
	Lap joints on the 2 X 4s were cut first for the two rectangles that made up the 
	sides. These were squared up and screwed together. The four boards that run across 
	the front and back bottom and top were cut next. The ends were rabbeted to fit the 
	sides and dadoes were cut to fit two verticals that hold the shelves and separate 
	the enclosed cabinet from the open metal holding shelves. These verticals were then 
	cut with rabbets at the top and bottom and with dadoes for the three shelves.
</p>

<p>
	Blocks were cut to support the bottom shelf. These were eventually screwed to the 
	the inside of the bottom cross pieces that ran across the front and the back. They 
	were 3/4" shorter than the 2 X 4s so the shelf would be level with these cross 
	pieces. The bottom shelf was cut in one piece that spanned the entire width of the 
	cabinet. The other two shelves were made in two pieces that met at the vertical 
	described above. Corners were cut out of all of the shelves to extend with the 
	opening rectangles in the sides. Notches were cut for the verticals, front and back. 
</p>

<p>
	The top was cut and the shelf dividers were cut to fit the existing box. A dado was 
	cut on the inside of the two verticals to hold the dividers in place. 3/16" plywood 
	was used for the dividers. A few minor modifications needed to be made to a few 
	boards during assembly, but all in all things went together quite well. Everything 
	was held together with screws.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, the back and side were covered with 3/16" plywood sheets held in place with 
	6 screws each. A simple door was made with 1 X 2 stock again with lap joints. The 
	four sides of the door had dadoes cut to hold the 3/16" plywood panel. When 
	attaching the door to the hinges it was noticed that the shelves stuck out a little 
	too far on the hinge side so the door would not close properly. Dadoes were cut in 
	the back of the left stile to accommodate the shelves. A doorknob was added as the 
	final touch.
</p>

<p class=note>
	A magnet may be added to hold the door shut if needed. The cabinet was painted 
	to match the lathe.
