	This nth approach is based on 
	<a href="http://sbebuilders.blogspot.com/2013/03/making-wood-polyhedron-or-wooden.html">
	a framer's blog</a>. Essentially the instructions are to cut the legs with a 70.5&deg; 
	included angle and then use 45&deg; for both the miter angle and the blade angle 
	when cutting the mating ends.
</p>

	Thirty lengths of pine were cut to 3/4" X 1" X 10" so that all were as near to 
	identical as possible. The blade was carefully angled to 35.25&deg; using the app, 
	HandyLevel, on the phone and a 1-2-3 block to keep the phone vertical. A jig made 
	previously was used to cut the triangular cross section. It has two settings, one for 
	making the first cut on the rectangular cross section and one for making the second 
	cut. The jig was recut with the new blade angle. Six legs were cut to the triangular 
	cross section. 
</p>

<p class="note">
	The final structure to be made of 5 inter-penetrating tetrahedra is formally known 
	as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_of_five_tetrahedra">compound of 
	five tetrahedra</a> or a stellated icosahedron.
</p>

<p>
	A second jig was then made to hold the triangular legs for cutting the ends 
	with the compound miter setup. This jig was essentially a board with a vee groove 
	cut down the middle and a clamp to hold the leg in place. The drill press fence was 
	repurposed for use on the table saw by drilling two holes that align with the miter 
	gauge. The 1/4" holes were countersunk and two 1/4-20 long bolts were used. The 
	blade was already set at the correct angle so the vee groove was cut about 7/8" deep 
	and centered in the 11" length of 2 X 4 used. A simple clamp was cut from poplar by 
	hand and two holes were drilled. The 'fixed' end was drilled 5/16" and the 'clamp' 
	end was drilled 1/4" for the two 1/4-20 screws. Matching holes were drilled in the 
	vee block about 2" from the cutting end. These holes were countersunk through the 
	vee block about 1".
</p>

<p class=note>
	After setting the 45&deg; miter angle it became clear that the clamp was probably 
	too close to the end so it had to be moved another 1" or so further from the blade 
	end of the jig so as to not cut the screws with the table saw. 
</p>

<p>
	After fixing the jig a trial part was cut. I snuck up on the correct distance so the 
	blade would cut across the point and no further. The six legs were then cut with 
	the miter set to 45&deg; on both ends. The miter was then repositioned to -45&deg; 
	and both ends were cut a second time. This gave a very neat set of legs with 
	symmetrical tapers to the endpoints.
</p>

<p class="note">
	It worked!!!! The angles are almost perfect when the legs are 'tripled' up. The next 
	challenge is figuring out how to 'clamp' the parts for gluing.
</p>

<p>
	The first attempt at 'clamping' the parts together consisted of linking a bunch of 
	rubber bands. Four rubber bands became corner holders, i.e. they were to loop around 
	the three legs that make up each corner of the tetrahedron. These were each linked 
	to the other three corner holders with three more rubber bands. The hope is that the 
	linking rubber bands will provide enough force to pull the corner holders down so 
	they exert sufficient force to hold the corners together for eventual gluing.
</p>

<p>
	It was necessary to clamp the bottom triangle at two corners after putting the 
	rubber band 'net' in place to free up the hands to align the top. There is no way 
	this could be done while inter-penetrating the tetrahedra. A picture of the first 
	tetrahedron is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/First tetrahedron.jpg" alt="First tetrahedron" width="1823" height="2825">

<p>
	With the positive proof of concept the remainder of the tetrahedra legs were cut 
	into triangular cross section and then mitered on the ends. About six hours were
	required to complete the legs for these four tetrahedra. An "artistic" color scheme 
	needs to be chosen. I am not sure if I want to use 4-5 different stains or use paint. 
	Decided to use paint. Purchased acrylic paint at an art store as it dries significantly 
	faster than oil based paint. Need to sand and prime the parts prior to painting.
</p>

<p>
	Sanded all of the legs with 100- and 200-grit sandpaper. Also sanded the three long 
	edges so they would not be quite so sharp. After removing the dust from sanding, the 
	parts were all primed with Kilz. The colors were chosen from a 10-pack of Reeves 
	acrylics: crimson, phthalo blue, phthalo green, yellow ochre, and a one-to-one mix of 
	medium yellow & light green. Six legs (a tetrahedron's worth) were painted in each 
	color. Two sides of each leg were painted and after drying the third side was painted. 
	For all colors except yellow ochre the paint dried to touch in about 1 hour. The 
	yellow ochre took 24 hours!!
</p>

<p>
	After struggling a bit the best way found to accomplish gluing the first tetrahedron 
	was to put T-88 epoxy on the bottom three joints, put the three legs in place with 
	the rubber band harness and a weight suspended across the bottom three legs. Epoxy 
	was put on the ends of the other three legs and these were inserted through the 
	rubber band harness. With Rhea's help holding two of the three top legs close to 
	position, the third leg was put in position followed by the other two. Multiple 
	careful adjustments were made to each of the corners in turn, while adjusting the 
	rubber bands for a symmetrical fit. This resulted a pretty well-built tetrahedron 
	held by the harness. Excess epoxy was wiped off. The joints were checked multiple 
	times over the next hour to make sure no slippage had occurred. Slipping was not a 
	problem during the dry run, but the epoxy is fairly slimy. The whole process took 
	about 45 minutes, so a slow-drying epoxy is the right choice.
</p>

<p>
	The second tetrahedron presented a few new challenges. The first tetrahedron needed 
	to be suspended by a vertex, so a three leg base for the second tetrahedron could be 
	formed. A triangular hole was cut in a shoe box with the sides 2.25" long. Longer 
	sides, 2.5", proved too long. With the first tetrahedron in place in the hole three 
	legs of the second tetrahedron were laid in place and the harness put around the 
	parts. Each of the three remaining legs were threaded through the bottom and top 
	harness holes and then moved into position. With a lot of adjusting the legs were 
	all held in the appropriate configuration. Spacers (1/8") were used between the 
	'vertical' legs of the first tetrahedron and the bottom legs of the second 
	tetrahedron. Otherwise the top legs of the first tetrahedron pushed too hard against 
	the last three legs of the second tetrahedron making it impossible to get them in 
	place.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Second tetrahedron.jpg" alt="Second tetrahedron" width="2078" height="2141">

<p>
	The top three legs were removed and the bottom three glued. Glue was put on the top 
	three, they were threaded into place, and then all legs were arranged as best as 
	possible to form the second tetrahedron. The vertices were adjusted as needed over 
	the next 30 minutes and then the whole was left to dry for 36 hours.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Oops! Another failure!! The third tetrahedron could not be fit within the first 
	two. The legs of the glued tetrahedra are too close together. The legs are too 
	fat!!! The original calculation determined a ratio of 12:1 for length vs height. 
	The legs produced here are 9&nbsp;5/8" long and 3/4" high. I think the problem is 
	the base of the triangle. It is 1" wide and the sides are 7/8". The overall size 
	of this triangle is too large. The next iteration should be closer to 
	10"&nbsp;X&nbsp;5/8". With a top angle of 69.7&deg; the bottom of the triangle will 
	then be 0.870" (or 7/8").
