	<a href="http://www.alisam.com/dremel-lantern.html">Alisam Engineering</a> makes a 
	Dremel holder for the South Bend lathe lantern tool post. I decided to make a 
	similar holder. It would have been useful for grinding the point on the punch part 
	of the bell center punch.
</p>

<p>
	Like the Dremel clamp I will use a threaded bushing instead of threading the part 
	directly. Knowing one measurement from the website I was able to estimate the other 
	dimensions. The height of the stem is 5/8" per the website. The overall length is 
	4". The height of the Dremel holding end is 1&nbsp;5/8". The width of the flat above 
	the hole is 1&nbsp;1/16". I estimated the angle to be 45&deg;.
</p>

<p>
	I just happen to have a 3/8" thick and 4" wide slab of aluminum. I cut off 1&nbsp;3/4" 
	with the band saw. I milled one side flat and perpendicular to the finished edge of the 
	aluminum. The aluminum was painted with bluing dye. The measurements were laid out 
	as shown in the photo below.
</p>

<p>
	The angled piece was removed with a hacksaw fairly easily. The bottom of the part was 
	set in the milling vise on parallels. The top of the flat was cut to the line in 
	0.015" increments with a 3/8" end mill. The part was then set at a 45&deg; angle with 
	a combination square. The angled side was cut to the line. Finally, the part was 
	returned to rest flat in the vise and the top edge was cut. The burrs were removed 
	with a small file and the inside corner was lightly filed with a round needle file.
</p>

<p>
	I plan to set the height of the hole by clamping the part in the lantern tool post 
	and then scribing a line with a center in the headstock spindle. I am not sure which 
	washer I will use under the part. The smallest washer, the original, is too small. 
	Setting two 9/64" drill bits on this washer puts the hole close to the bottom, but 
	acceptable. The screw is not long enough for a lower setting! I guess I should have 
	made the width 3/4" instead of 5/8". At any rate a 0.425" washer is required.
</p>

<p>
	Second thoughts after a night's sleep. Raising the holder implies the hole is lower. 
	If the holder is raised 1/8" as suggested above the hole for the insert is now only 
	1/8" or so above the bottom. This is too close for comfort. Instead I am going to 
	add a 1/4" piece to the top. This was done by first squaring the side of the cutoff 
	from above. The 1/4" high part was cut off with a hacksaw. The part was set on 
	parallels and squared in the mill. The pieces were clamped together with a machinist's 
	clamp. The parts were then drilled for a screw close to the middle of the two joined 
	parts. The hole was drilled with a center drill and then with a #29 drill to a depth 
	of 0.64". The first 0.25" was opened with a #17 drill. The tap was started and a few 
	8-32 threads were cut. The tap was removed and a countersink was used to deeply 
	countersink the hole. The parts were separated and the tapping was completed. A screw 
	was installed and the second hole was made the same way. Finally, with two screws 
	installed the end of the new piece was trimmed flush with a 3/8" end mill. The 
	photo shows the completed budgie job. The holder was installed in the lathe and the 
	height marked with a center in the headstock.

<p class="note">
	A slight detour in effort this morning. The cable arrived for the inverter. Of course, 
	it attaches to the back of the controller, so to mount it a hole had to be drilled in 
	the cabinet. A large hole! Through a 2X4! The batteries were dead in the cordless 
	drill so I pulled out Heshe's old drill. A 1&nbsp;5/8" Forstner bit was used. After 
	about 30 minutes I had forced my way through the cabinet frame. A similar hole was 
	drilled in the 1/4" thick back in a minute or two. The cable was snaked through the 
	cabinet and attached to the inverter and to the controller. Works perfectly. I will 
	no longer need to reach around the lathe and over the cabinet to turn the lathe off!
	The photo below shows the controller velcro'd to the cabinet. The inverter can be 
	seen against the wall.

<p>
	The location of the hole center was marked and punched. It is centered 3/4" from the 
	end. The holder was aligned in the four jaw chuck on the South Bend lathe. One jaw 
	had to be reversed. The hole was drilled with a center drill and then up to 3/4". 
	The hole was opened by boring to 0.995". The photo shows the result.
</p>

<p>
	I found a scrap of 1" brass round bar that was 0.413" long and had a 3/8" hole in 
	the middle. The scrap was faced on the rough side. A mandrel was made from a second 
	scrap of 3/8" hex brass. It had a 3/8" round end, which fit nicely in the hole. The 
	end was drilled with a #25 drill and threaded 10-24 because I had a flat head 10-24 
	screw. The hole was threaded and then chamfered deeply for the screw head to apply 
	the expansive force. The screw was cut to length. The end of the mandrel was cut 
	with a hacksaw to produce four slots. Everything was cleaned up and the mandrel held 
	the brass part tightly. The brass was not very concentric on the mandrel, but its 
	diameter was reduced to 0.995".
</p>

<p>
	The brass insert was bored to 0.665" as measured with the aid of a hole gauge. The 
	Sherline lathe was set up for threading 3/4-12. With a lot of effort the threads were 
	cut to a depth of approximately 0.063". I don't think the threading tool can cut any 
	deeper. The threading was challenging because the gear train came loose on three 
	occasions! It is a tight fit on the Dremel, but it fits! The aluminum part was sanded 
	on the two faces with 220-grit sand paper. The brass was then pressed into its mating 
	hole to complete the Dremel tool holder.

<p>
	The holder was tried out this morning. The compound was set at 30&deg; and the Dremel 
	was aligned with the compound. A tailstock half center was held in a 1/4" collet. 
	The grinding wheel was run past the center in 0.002" increments. The Dremel rotates 
	counterclockwise as seen from the end. The lathe also rotates counterclockwise. I 
	would expect that one rotating in the opposite direction would be preferred, but 
	have no data to back this up. A paper towel was used to catch the dust. Probably not 
	the wisest choice using paper to catch red sparks. The grinding went well. There was 
	significant high speed chatter as can be seen in the finish. It is not clear if this 
	is due to rotation direction, speeds and feeds, flex in the tool, or the interrupted 
	cut. The photo shows the setup after grinding.
