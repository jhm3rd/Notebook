<p class=first>
	I took a Marquetry course taught by Marc Adams. As expected his course was intense. 
	I took a lot of notes and some of them might make it into this page. The first thing 
	to be covered is the concluding steps to the work begun during the course. Two pieces 
	were completed during the course, sans finishing.
</p>

<p>
	Lacquer is one of Marc's recommended ways to finish marquetry pieces. He said the 
	lacquer should be sprayed. Due to the problems I have had previously with spraying 
	lacquer, e.g. bandsaw puzzle boxes, I used a brush. Both pieces were given two coats 
	of lacquer after sanding to 220 grit (sanding done at class). The two photos below 
	show the pieces. Both pieces need to be framed.
</p>

<p>
	The third unfinished piece was the collage of geometric designs. This is usually 
	called parquetry as opposed to marquetry, which are pictures. Some of the parts 
	made in class needed to be cut into the background. This was done with an Xacto 
	knife. The pieces were taped together and in place with blue tape. A few weeks later 
	it was time to glue the venner to the MDF board. I read through my notes and 
	discovered that Marc recommends only one layer of blue tape for parquetry pieces when 
	gluing. Most of the parts had multiple layers of tape. Some were fixed by pulling up 
	and cutting off overlapping ends. Most had to be completely retaped. This was a slow
	and carefully done process so as not to tear up the small delicate pieces. The photo 
	below shows the finished retaping. The second photo shows the side that will be 
	glued.
</p>

<p>
	The vacuum box was pulled out from behind the lathe and laid on the garage floor. 
	The plastic mesh was cut to fit within the lid's frame. It was laid in place and 
	covered with a layer of paper. The parquetry collage was laid tape side down on the 
	paper. Glue was spread on the MDF backing that had been prepared in class. (I didn't 
	like the spreader I have as well as the Hyde spreaders used at Marc Adams. One needs 
	to be ordered from Ace.) The glue dried for about five minutes before the board was 
	aligned with and placed on the veneer. The lid was placed on the torsion box and 
	vacuum was applied. Some pressure on the lid was required to seal it sufficiently 
	for the pump to work. The photo shows the piece under vacuum. There is more squeeze 
	out than expected. The pump is cycling every two minutes, not the best seal.
</p>

<p>
	After two hours the vacuum was released. There was some glue on the plastic of the 
	vacuum lid. The box was opened. The paper was stuck tight to the image. The majority 
	of the paper came off. The paper felt slightly damp. The piece will be left overnight 
	to make sure it is dry before proceeding.
</p>

<p>
	The piece was good and dry two days later. First, some scraping was done. Second, the 
	tape was removed, followed again by scraping off as much glue as possible. The piece 
	was sanded with 120 grit paper to remove the rest of the glue. After three sheets of 
	paper the scraper was used to remove recalcitrant glue in three spots. After a 
	complete sanding with 120 the paper was changed to 220 grit and the surface sanded. 
	The back was sanded with 220 grit. The first photo shows the piece after some initial 
	scraping and tape removal. The second photo shows the piece after sanding was complete.

<p>
	The first coat of varnish was applied with a brush as was the second, two hours later. 
	And the final third coat was an additional two hours later. A third coat was needed 
	for this piece because a brush hair was left in the second coat and had to be removed 
	and the piece lightly sanded. The final collage is below.

<p>
	A fourth piece was begun in class, but the marquetry was not finished. It is a 
	complex image of flowers. There is one packet that remains to be finished. I spent 
	some time figuring out how best to build this piece up. I taped on the new part to 
	be added, punched a hole for the blade and set the packet up in the scroll saw. 
	Cutting was a nightmare! Not only did the keeper crack, but the underlying piece 
	fractured and a huge chunk blew out. The problem was obvious upon closer inspection.
	The opening for the blade in the scroll saw is huge relative to the size of the 
	pieces being cut. There is no support on the bottom of the packet. I don't think a 
	piece of tape will work. A possibility would be affixing a plate to the current table 
	putting a small hole through it. Changing the blade might be a challenge. It is 
	already difficult to change.
</p>

<p>
	There are two main types of scroll saws based on my perusal of the internet. The 
	older style with a long U-shaped mechanism and a rotating table. The style used by 
	the more expensive saws has a fixed table and the U rotates. The saws currently on my 
	list are the DeWalt 20" VS, Pegas 21" Scroll Saw Machine, King Industrial 16" Scroll 
	Saw, and the Jet 18" Scroll Saw. All of these except the DeWalt are the second type. 
	I sent an email to Marc Adams to seek his advice. I am worried that the fixed table 
	will not be ideal for marquetry.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Just ordered the DeWalt scroll saw used at MASW. Marc recommended this saw in his 
	email reply. $535 from Home Depot was the cheapest and should be delivered tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
	The new scroll saw arrived. It is bigger than I expected. More importantly the back 
	end is not the same as those at MASW. However, it does fit when set off to the side 
	of the pipe in the middle of the table. However, when the table is in place the 
	lazy susan can now only rotate partway. All tools can be accessed, but using the 
	belt sender will be challenging. I might be able to move the belt sander further 
	forward and gain the needed three inches of additional space.
