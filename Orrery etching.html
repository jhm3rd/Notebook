<p class=first>
	As I was dissatisfied with the engraving I did on the orrery so another route will 
	be explored. Two previous pages (<a href="etch test.html">Reversed & Inverted</a> 
	and <a href="Etching printout.html">Printout for Etching</a>)
	have dealt with preparing the requisite printouts for etching 
	the orrery. This page will focus on etching experiments and application 
	to the orrery. 
</p>

<p>
	The first things to do were to print the designs on the special paper and prepare 
	a polished piece of brass for transfer and etching. The printout was fairly simple. 
	Avery 3279 Transfer Paper was utilized. The printer prints on the bottom of the 
	piece of paper inserted into the printer, so the silicone side was placed in the 
	paper tray face down. A number of the various patterns were duplicated on the 
	<a href="Etching printout.html">Printout for Etching</a> page just for these 
	experiments. The text to be printed on the planet rings were not printed at this 
	time.
</p>

<p>
	A piece of unused dodecagon was pulled from the scrap bin to serve as a test bed. 
	It was sanded from 220 to 1500 grit on both faces. (Gloves were worn throughout 
	the sanding and subsequent polishing.) Polishing with red rouge on a cotton wheel 
	came next. Too much rouge was applied to the wheel initially. The excess was removed 
	with a wooden block. The brass part got quite hot to the touch. The black material 
	that was caked on was removed with soap and water. The trapezoid was dried and 
	three more repeats of the polishing process gave a pretty good shine.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Nice view of the printout to be transferred.
</p>

<p>
	The printout was cut so that a month could be transferred to the polished brass 
	rhomboid. Reading the instructions carefully, hinted at a major problem. The 
	backing was carefully peeled off of the paper and the resulting material was 
	placed on the brass print side up!!! A piece of tissue paper was placed on the 
	brass covering the printed month. The iron at high temp and without steam was 
	held on the tissue paper for 45 seconds. This is really a hot gluing process!! 
	the entire design was now glued to the brass. I guess this is how the printout 
	is supposed to stick to a tee shirt. Back to the store for silicone paper, not 
	transfer paper.
</p>

<p>
	PCB transfer paper was purchased from Amazon. Put the "etch test.pdf" file on a flash 
	drive and drove to Office Depot. Unfortunately, they could not read the Mac formatted 
	flash drive. Went home and emailed the file to Office Depot. The file was printed 
	first on a laser printer on regular paper. All looked good, so it was printed on the 
	blue side of the transfer paper. The printout looked perfect, I paid the $1.50, and 
	drove home with transfers ready to for etching. The previously polished brass scrap 
	needed some cleanup and repolishing. I also need to carefully think through the 
	process for etching the brass once the transfer has been applied. Expecting a delay 
	the printout was replaced in the original packaging to keep the transfer gel from 
	drying out. Further net research indicates that overhead transparencies also work 
	well and allow easier visualization when during the ironing process.
</p>

<p>
	A brass trapezoid with some engraving was pulled from scrap. The new sanding belt 
	was used to give it a rough sand. This quickly removed the engraved letters. The 
	brass got quite hot to the touch even with very short sanding times. Will need to 
	keep water close by when sanding the larger frame top.The brass was then sanded with 
	150, 320, 400, 600, 1000, & 1500 grit paper to an almost mirror finish.
</p>

<p>
	Before applying the transfer a prototype application was attempted. Two pieces of 
	regular paper were cut out. One had a constellation and one had a month. An edge 
	was folded over to serve as a register when applying the paper to the brass. Taping 
	these two down was difficult due to static attraction between the paper and the 
	packing tape. It was possible, however, printing the needed set of items for each 
	brass part on one piece of paper will be a much better process. The same taping 
	was then applied to the transfer paper cutouts. The iron was heated to its highest 
	setting (without steam). The iron was then placed on the brass with a piece of paper 
	between it and the taped on transfers. It was held in place for about two minutes. 
	It was rotated slightly about five or six times as the bottom of the iron has holes. 
	The brass was allowed to cool to warm over about five minutes. The tape had clearly 
	melted leaving some dried glue/plastic on the exposed brass. The transfer paper was 
	gently peeled up and there was just a mess under it. Something was transferred but 
	no constellation or month was visible! I do not know if this failure was due to the 
	melting tape or some other factor.
</p>

<h3>Learning from the failure</h3>
