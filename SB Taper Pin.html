<p class=first>
	The South Bend needs a taper pin to hold the handle onto the tailstock. When purchased 
	the handle was held on with a roll pin, that was not very effective. The hole was 
	"measured" with transfer punches. The large diameter was a good fit for the 5/32" 
	punch. The small hole was somewhere between 1/8" and 9/64". The size of the collar 
	on the handle is 0.840".
</p>

<p>
	Taper pins were looked up on "Machinery's Handbook". Using the information in the 
	Handbook a calculator was made to determine the small end diameter for any length 
	of a given size taper pin. (Taper pins are sized by the diameter of the large end.) 
	The calculator indicates the small end diameter should be 0.1385". I do not plan to 
	harden the pin. I also did not plan on putting an accurate radius on the ends of the 
	pin, only filing or sanding a chamfer.
</p>

<p class=note>
	The plan for making the taper was to turn the stock down to the large diameter, 
	0.156", and rotating the headstock approximately 1.2&deg;. The angle of the 
	headstock will be adjusted to 0.25"/foot or 0.021"/inch with a dial indicator.
</p>

<p>
	A 0.25" steel round bar was placed in the chuck with about 1" exposed. This was 
	reduced to 0.156" for 1". The headstock was rotated about 1&deg; and the angle was 
	checked with the dial indicator. The headstock was rotated in small increments and
	the angle was rechecked until the displacement over 0.75" was between 0.015" and 
	0.016". A 1" length was reduced about 0.021" to produce the taper. The free end 
	was rounded with a file. The stock was parted off at 0.84" from the non-rounded 
	line on the stock. The final overall dimensions are 0.837" long, large diameter is 
	0.154" and the small diameter is 0.123".
</p>

<p>
	The small end was significantly smaller than expected. The pin fit well in the hole 
	and was gently tapped in with a ball peen hammer. Now I can get the drill chuck out 
	of the tailstock!!
