<p class=first>
	While waiting for the hot plate for transferring numbers onto the D&D dice, a 
	machining diversion was found, a sine bar, whose manufacture was described in 
	Machinist's Workshop, Vol. 32, No. 1, 2019.  
</p>

<p>
	A scrap of 1/2" thick aluminum about 3&nbsp;1/2" long was located in the scrap box. 
	It was marked out for hole locations using the Starrett height gauge. With the aluminum 
	block held in the vise on the mill, set perpendicular to the table with dial gauge, 
	the first hole was located and drilled 3/16" (probably should have reamed to 3/16"). 
	The table was moved 3.000" and the second hole was drilled. About half of the block 
	was sawn off with the hacksaw as shown in the photo below.
</p>

<p>
	The 
	majority of the inside waste was removed with a 1/2" end mill lowered vertically 
	through the part as seen in the following photos. Due to the supports the last 1/32" 
	of material was not removed initially, but only after changing the setup to parallels 
	at the ends, not quite as sturdy, but sufficient for the small amount removed.
</p>

<p>
	The rotary table was set on the milling table and centered with the dial gauge. A 
	bronze spud was made to sit on a screw with a 1/4" round extension in the lathe to 
	fit the 3/16" holes. The part was held in place with a step clamp using a brass block 
	and paper packing underneath. The round end was then milled to most of a circle and 
	the final handwheel setting was noted. The other end of the part was set up similarly 
	and also milled to the noted handwheel setting. Neither end was milled all the way to 
	the inside as too much material had to be removed and this setup was not conducive to 
	removing that much aluminum. The first photo below shows the beginning of milling one 
	end round. The second shows the sine bar at this stage of construction.
</p>

<p>
	The nascent sine bar was clamped to an angle plate with a machinist's clamp. The 
	inside area next to the round ends was milled out with a 5/16" end mill. The part 
	was returned to the rotary table and the inside parts of the ends were rounded.
</p>

<p>
	The part was held with the inside up in the vise. The inside was milled flat along 
	its length as seen in the first photo below. The part was flipped over and the ends 
	were set on parallels before clamping the bar in the vise. The top side was milled 
	with the two insert end mill until a nice finish was achieved as seen in the second 
	photo below.

<p>
	Burrs were removed and the sides sanded completing the sine bar. It is seen below 
	set on a 1-2-3 block. The angle is determined as follows:
</p>
	<p class="centered">1" = sine &theta; X 3"</p> 
	<p class="centered">&theta; = sin<sup>-1</sup> 1/3</p>
	<p class="centered">&theta; = 19.47&deg;</p>

<img class=inline src="Snbr/SNBR sine bar.heic" alt="The completed sine bar set for a 19.5 degree angle." width="2085" height="1573">

<p>
	I don't possess a sufficiently accurate level to check the sine bar. The phone when 
	set on the bar above indicated the angle was 19&deg; or 20&deg; varying from 
	measurement to measurement.
