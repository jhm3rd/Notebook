	Mr. Puzzle featured a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qy0ZN3b_E4">puzzle</a> 
	called Feed the Monkey two years ago. This morning I began reproducing this puzzle. 
	The puzzle consists of trying to insert 17 rods into the opening in the top. The 
	rods are 1" long except for the last which is 2" long. The storage within the box is 
	only sufficient to hold 16 rods side-by-side, which brings up the hidden trick. The 
	photos below show the puzzle and the spot for hiding an extra 1" rod.
</p>

<p>
	The puzzle is to be constructed from brass and wood. The ends will be made of 
	brass and the box in the middle of wood. I found a 1&nbsp;1/8" bar of square brass. 
	Two pieces 1&nbsp;1/8" long were cut off with the bandsaw. These were squared up 
	by clamping them to an angle plate, making sure the free side was square to the 
	table and cutting with the two flute cutter. The opposite face was squared relative 
	to the just cut face in the vise. Both blocks were faced to 1.01".
</p>

<p>
	The next step is removing most of the sides to produce a lip all around the two cubes. 
	The two cubes were held in the vise. A slip of paper was used to shim one block. It is 
	about 0.001" shorter than the other. About .20" was milled down in increments of 
	0.020" with a 3/8" four flute end mill. The rabbet was milled to a depth of 0.184". 
	This rabbet was then widened to 0.750" in increments of 0.025". The milling proceeded 
	smoothly with no chatter and minimal noise. The photo shows the completed side on 
	both blocks. Three more sides to go.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fedThMonk/FM side milled.jpg" alt="One side of two cubes milled leaving a lip" width="1474" height="1515">

<p class="note">
	Before completing the sides the 5/16" hole should be drilled in one of the blocks. 
	If the hole is drilled after completely milling a corner, the drill will probably 
	wander and the hole won't be straight. The edge of the hole should align with the 
	corner of adjacent milled sides. The center of the hole is at least 0.254" in from 
	the unmilled adjacent sides.
</p>

<p class="note">
	A thought occurred to me at 4 am. The slot in the 3/4" square that will hold a rod 
	needs to be 1" long at its corners. The diagonal on a 3/4" square is 1.06" long. This 
	is not long enough to hold a 1" rod as the corners will stick out and interfere with 
	the sides of the enclosing box. The math says the sides of this slot will be 0.8725" 
	long. So the rods need to be < 0.87" long. The box will need to be shortened a bit 
	for the puzzle to work.
</p>

<p>
	The top of one block was marked out for a hole at 0.254" in from both sides. A 
	through hole was carefully drilled with a #12 (0.189") drill. The second side was 
	milled in the same way as the first. This took over an hour so the last two sides 
	were cut first with the hacksaw and then milled to final size. My hacksaw work was 
	not perfect, but gave acceptable results in the end as seen in the photo below. All 
	edges were deburred. The milled part of the blocks are 3/4" cubes and the lip is 1/4" 
	thick and 3/16" deep.
</p>

<p>
	The block with a drilled hole was returned to the vise. One corner was held in a 
	Vee block and the opposite corner fit in the Vee slot in the fixed jaw. The block 
	was also placed on a 1/2" block to raise the top sufficiently for slotting. An edge 
	finder was used to align the spindle with a corner adjacent to the drilled corner. 
	A 3/16" end mill was placed in the collet and the slot was milled to a depth of 
	0.190" in increments of 0.010". A scrap of 3/16" brass rod was a tight fit in the 
	slot, so it was widened about 0.02". The burrs were removed.
</p>

<p>
	The box needs to be made. A 4" length of scrap was cut into four 3/16" thick slabs. 
	These are about 1&nbsp;1/4" wide. Two of these were cut to 3/4" width. The four sides 
	were glued around the two end caps using simple butt joints. After ten minutes the 
	end caps were removed so as to avoid gluing them in place.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fedThMonk/FM box glued.jpg" alt="The four sides glued into a box" width="1690" height="1409">

<p>
	The top cap was coated with China white. The monkey design was sketched on the white. 
	The monkey was engraved in the top around the drilled hole per the screen grab above. 
	All of the outer faces and edges were sanded to 2000 grit. The bottom face was 
	polished on the buffer.
</p>

<p>
	The box was sanded to bring the sides flush. One end was marked for the top cap. It 
	had the least to remove for the hole. The box was marked at 2&nbsp;7/16" and cut 
	with the Japanese pull saw. The ends were cleaned up and glue was removed from the 
	inside corners. The assembled box is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fedThMonk/FM box assembled.jpg" alt="The end caps inserted into the box" width="1291" height="1493">

<p>
	The box and caps need to be drilled for screws. The wood and the brass need to be 
	finished. The "bananas" need to be made. That will be done first to make sure 
	everything works as planned.
</p>

<p>
	A 2+ foot length of 3/16" brass rod was held in the three jaw chuck. An outboard 
	steady rest (my hand) was used to keep the rod from whipping around. The first end 
	was faced. An inch of the rod was sanded and then parted off at 0.875". The rod 
	was moved out another inch, sanded and parted at the same length. This was repeated 
	until 16 rods were produced. The last rod was made similarly, but 1.875" long. The 
	photo below shows the rods cut to length.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fedThMonk/FM cut rods.jpg" alt="The seventeen rods cut to length" width="1516" height="1354">

<p>
	The ends of the rods were rounded. A rod was held in a collet and the end rounded 
	with a file. The coarse side was followed with the fine. The longer rod was also 
	held in the collet. This filing was accompanied with chatter as expected for the 
	1" overhang. All 34 ends were quickly rounded as seen in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fedThMonk/FM rounded rods.jpg" alt="The seventeen rods with rounded ends" width="1475" height="1556">

<p>
	The monkey's mouth overlaps with the wood in the corner of the box. This has to be 
	cut away to foster banana ingestion. The first photo below shows the corner marked 
	for cutting. A round rasp and round files were used to open the corner until the 
	long rod slipped right through. The banana consuming ability of the monkey was put 
	to the test. It is very difficult even knowing the trick. The bananas when added are 
	supposed to stack. This can be accomplished, but requires care during the insertion. 
	Shortening the box might improve the banana alignment. Getting the bananas out is 
	almost as difficult as putting them in.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fedThMonk/FM sunken rod.jpg" alt="The long rod buried in the mouth" width="1092" height="1157">

<p>
	The long rod is a little over 1/16" below the opening of the mouth. The box could be 
	shortened by 1/16" and things should be better at staying aligned. Rod misalignment 
	was found when having difficulty inserting all of the rods. The box was shortened by 
	sanding. The rods align better, though it is still a very challenging puzzle.
</p>

<p>
	The caps were painted with Protecta-Clear and the box (after sanding to 320) with 
	lacquer. Four 1/2" long #4-40 round head screws were located in the screw hoard. The 
	puzzle was assembled. Four holes were marked on center 3/8" from the end of the wood. 
	The wood was drilled with a 9/64" drill bit and the brass was drilled with a #42 drill. 
	The four holes in the brass were tapped with a 4-40 tap. The screws needed about 1/8" 
	removed. The assembled puzzle is seen below. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="fedThMonk/FM assembled.jpg" alt="The finished and assembled puzzle" width="1107" height="1450">

<p class="note">
	The challenge with this puzzle is that the bananas tend to get stuck at an angle upon 
	insertion. Once stuck they can be recalcitrant to properly aligning. This is probably 
	because the length of the rods, 7/8", is too close to the width of the box. Longer 
	rods would fix this issue. Longer rods necessitates making a new box.
</p>

<p>
	I used a differenet approach for the box this time. A scrap of redwood or cyprus was 
	found and cut to 1&nbsp;1/8&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/8&nbsp;X&nbsp;3". A 3/4" spade bit 
	was used to drill in from both ends producing a round hold through the block of 
	wood. A 16 mm chisel was used to remove material from all four corners on both ends.
	A bit of adjustment was needed for the caps to fit. A corner was chosen and filed 
	so the long rod would smoothly slide through the opening in the top cap. The box 
	was then cut to length at 2&nbsp;9/16". This give a 1&nbsp;1/16" inner box for rods.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fedThMonk/FM new box II.jpg" alt="The new box showing the chiseled inside" width="1156" height="1117">

<p class="note">
	While sleeping on the project I realized the error I made above. Moving to longer 
	rods is not possible, considering the slot that one of the rods must fit. I don't 
	know if careful calculations would help with the rods sticking at an angle. An 
	alternative is the smoothness of the inside of the box. In any event I can't really 
	explore either, so I will use one rod slightly shorter than the others.
</p>

<p>
	The box was marked and drilled. The two holes for the top cap screws needed some 
	adjustment with a file so the cap was not held too far off center. The box was 
	sanded to 320 grit. The caps screwed in place are seen below. Looking closely to 
	the left of the top cap screw shows the "hole correction". Washers may be in order.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fedThMonk/FM new box screwed.jpg" alt="The new box with the end caps screwed in place" width="1218" height="1551">

<p>
	Lacquer is again my finish of choice as it is so simple. The box with the caps removed 
	had two coats of semi-gloss lacquer applied. The box was put together. There was a 
	bit of friction between the walls and the long rod, so a bit more material was removed 
	from the entry corner. Fifteen new 1" long rods were made on the lathe. An old shorter 
	rod was added to this bunch and the puzzle now works flawlessly. Below are the 
	bananas (minus the short banana) and the hungry monkey.

	Monkey doesn't like disgorging the bananas as much as it likes eating them!
