<p class=first>
	After the <a href="Awl.html">awl</a> I have a hankering to make more woodworking 
	tools. This next project is from ShopNotes Vol. 117, pg 32. The plan is to make a 
	pair of marking knives. The difference between marking knives and regular knives is 
	the bevel is only on one side of the knife. I will make one knife that is beveled 
	on the left side and one that is beveled on the right. The handles will be made 
	from walnut. A picture of the knives in ShopNotes is included below.
</p>

<p>
	The first step is laying out the knives. Oil hardening tool steel was purchased from 
	Grainger. It is 1/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1&nbsp;1/2". A 6&nbsp;1/2" length is needed for 
	two knives. I could not find my spray can of Dykem layout dye so I covered a 
	6&nbsp;1/2" length of the steel with blue Sharpie ink. Two knives were marked out 
	side by side with a scribe. If you look closely, you can see the layout lines in 
	the picture below. The holes are centered on the width of knife at that point.
</p>

<p>
	The six holes were punched, center drilled and drilled through with a 1/8" drill. 
	A hacksaw was used to cut out the two blades from the steel blank. The two rough 
	cut blades are shown in the photo below. To get the blades to final shape the rough 
	cut blades were initially filed to the line. This works, but only for small sections 
	that are close to the line. For greater metal removal the blade was sanded with the 
	belt sander. It was important to be careful and not let the blade get too hot. The 
	blades were held with a wrench and against a fence while sanding. A bevel was then 
	filed by hand on the cutting ends of the blades. One blade was beveled on the left 
	side and one blade had the bevel filed on the right side. Both bevels were filed at 
	approximately 25&deg;. The blades filed/sanded to this stage are shown on the right 
	below.
</p>

<p>
	The blades were hardened this afternoon. (Rhea's birthday knives showed up today as 
	well.) They were heated until orange and then quenched in oil. Neither blade was 
	sufficiently hard when checked with a file. The heating was repeated and I made 
	sure that the knives were bright orange prior to quenching. This time neither blade 
	was marked by the file. After hardening the blades were tempered. I was worried 
	they might smell so I tempered them on the grill. The grill was heated to ~325&deg; 
	and the temperature was maintained for one hour. Only one burner was used and it was 
	set about halfway between the low and medium settings. The blades were allowed to 
	cool to the external temperature of 85&deg; on the open grill.
</p>

<p>
	The exposed part of the blades was then sanded. The sanding began with 220 grit 
	paper and proceeded with 320, 400, 600, 1000, and 1500 grits. The blades were then 
	honed on a stone with oil. Not razor sharp, but sharp enough.
</p>

<p>
	A block of cherry or walnut was found that was about 1"&nbsp;x&nbsp;4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;8". 
	It was cut to size and split into two handle blanks. Each blank was 3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;7/8".
	Each of these blanks was split down the middle to provide four 3/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4" 
	handle sides. The four sides were labeled and cut to 5" length. The blades were marked 
	out on the inner faces of the handles. The handle sides were cut to rough shape with 
	the Japanese pull saw. A photo of the rough handles is shown below.
</p>

<p>
	The handles were shaped with a rasp, file and 150 grit paper after taping the blades. 
	Three hours did not quite finish the first handle. I attempted to glue one side of 
	each handle to the blade. The spray glue used was a mess. It was sufficient to allow 
	drilling through the first side using the blade as template. This first side and 
	blade was then used to drill through the second side. After one hole was drilled a 
	1" brass pin was inserted prior to drilling the second hole. A second pin was put in 
	place prior to drilling the third hole. With two pins in place and not pushed 
	completely through, one side was shaped with the rasp and file. The pins were pushed 
	through to the other side and the second side was shaped. When the handles were close 
	to final shape, the pins were cut to about 1/16" longer than the width of the handle 
	at the hole. The pin was pushed into place. When all three pins were cut and in place 
	they were peened with a ball peen hammer. At this point sanding was begun in earnest.
</p>

<p>
	The handles were sanded with 150 grit paper to smooth and also to get the wood level 
	with the metal tang. A lot of sanding was required to accomplish this leveling as 
	well as remove the scratch marks from the rasp. After getting the surface to some 
	semblance of smooth the handles were sanded with 220 grit sandpaper. This left a 
	very nice finish. Dust was vacuumed and the tape was removed from the blades. The 
	spray glue was still sticky on the blades. The stickiness was removed with 
	isopropanol. The best thing found to remove the hardened glue was a fingernail. The 
	knives at this stage are shown below.
</p>

<p class="note">
	A storage block of some kind needs to be made to protect the blades and fingers. In 
	the meantime a block of foam will serve the purpose.
</p>

<p>
	The handles were finished with two coats of tung oil applied at 24 hour intervals. 
	Found a block of saved foam that had two layers. The top layer was covered with 
	black felt. A 1&nbsp;1/2" hole was marked with a hole saw. The top layer was cut 
	around this circle. The outline of the knife was cut through the top layer. The 
	cut material was removed leaving a space for the knife and a hole for finger access. 
	This was repeated for the second knife. An adequate knife home for now.
