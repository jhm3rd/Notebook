	An <a href="https://www.sjobergs.se/dbhires/Sjobergs_Smart_Vise.pdf">exploded 
	diagram of Sjoberg's Smart Vise</a> is available on the internet at their 
	website. A few dimensions can be gleaned from this diagram and their description. 
	Based on this information a copy of this vise was sketched out. A number of 
	modifications were made to simplify my construction. The best screw in the right 
	price range turned out to be a 12" length of 7/8-9 threaded rod. Two connector 
	nuts were also purchased. Finally a 3' length of 1/2" drill rod was ordered as 
	well.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Sjoberg fixed and movable jaws.jpg" alt="Jaws before assembly" width="2859" height="2276">

<p>
	The vise is over 2" thick and the movable jaw is similarly over 2" wide. Some 3/4"
	Baltic birch plywood was still available (37" X 37") so this became the basis for 
	making this vise. The first item on the agenda was building the Baltic birch up to 
	the required thickness. The base is made of three layers and grooved to fit the 
	screw and two stabilizing rods. Two 10 3/8" X 14 1/2" pieces of the Birch plywood 
	(one 3/4" thick and one 1/2" thick) were cut and glued face to face with a same 
	sized piece of 1/4" MDF sandwiched between. Similarly the top was made from one 
	14 1/2" X 12" piece of baltic and three 1/2" pieces (sufficient to span the 12" 
	dimension of the top) of oak that was on hand. These were glued up to form the 
	1 1/4" thick top. The fixed jaw was made from three 2" X 14 1/2" lengths of Baltic 
	birch and the movable jaw was made from three 2 1/2" X 14 1/2" lengths of Baltic 
	birch and one length of 1/2" oak. All parts were allowed to dry for 24 hours before 
	use. A plane was used to flatten the sides of the different parts.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom had three dadoes cut in it to serve as grooves for the moving screw and 
	stabilizer bars. The dadoes for the stabilizer bars were slightly over 1/2" wide 
	and 1" deep for the full length of the base. Similarly, the dado for the screw was 
	cut 7/8" wide and 1 3/16" deep. A 3/8" X 3/4" deep rabbet was cut across the face 
	of the base. A similar rabbet was cut in the back side of the fixed jaw. Six screw 
	holes were drilled in the fixed jaw and the front side of the base. Machine screws 
	(10-24) were used to join the parts. The fixed jaw was clearance drilled and the 
	holes were transferred to the base. The holes in the base were drilled and threaded. 
	The holes in the fixed were countersunk about 1" to fit the screw heads.
</p>

<p>
	A 2" X 1/2" rabbet was cut in the top so it would fit over the fixed jaw. Six 
	screws were used to hold the top to the base. The base was clearance drilled 
	and the holes were transferred to the top. The top was drilled and threaded, 
	while the bottom was countersunk for the machine screws. Before assembly the fixed 
	jaw needed to be drilled for the screw and the two stabilizers and the nut had 
	to be embedded in the central groove. A pocket was chiseled in the central dado 
	about two inches from the front of the base. The pocket was sized to fit a nut 
	that had been cut in half with a hacksaw. The nut was put in place with two 
	parallel sides running vertical to align with the pocket. With this nut in place 
	the position of the 1" clearance hole in the fixed jaw could be determined. The 
	end of the screw was liberally covered with graphite from a pencil and then 
	rotated to mark the back of the fixed jaw. This 1" hole was drilled through using 
	a Forstner bit. The two 1/2" stabilizer rod holes were drilled 11/16" from the 
	bottom of the fixed jaw. Holes were transferred to the movable jaw and 1/2" holes 
	were drilled in the top to a depth of 1" for the stops.
</p>

<p>
	The next objective was a system for trapping the screw in the movable jaw. The 
	screw was centered drilled in the drill press by clamping it vertically. The first 
	time this was attempted the screw came loose and the center drill broke off. A 
	second attempt with firmer clamping led to a center drilled pocket. The screw 
	was then held in a three jaw chuck with aluminum soft jaws and with a live center 
	in the tailstock. A 1/4" groove was cut in the screw about 3" from one end. This 
	placed the groove just inside the side of the movable jaw with about 3/4" hanging 
	out the other side. The groove was cut to a diameter of 0.65". A 1 1/2" square 
	of 1/4" brass was squared up in the mill. A 0. 7" center hole was drilled and 
	bored in the lathe. Four holes were drilled through for a #6 wood screw and 
	counter sunk for the head. The square part was aligned with the hole in the 
	movable jaw and the four holes were transferred to the jaw. The transferred holes 
	were drilled for the four screws. The square was also outlined on the inside face 
	of the jaw. A chisel was used to cut a pocket to a depth of 1/4". This brass part 
	was then cut in half with a hacksaw and the new edges filed smooth. A test fit and 
	screw was efficiently trapped in the movable jaw. A bearing was needed for the 
	external nut to ride against when turning the screw. An gear making failure was 
	used for this bearing. The gear was slightly larger than 1 1/2" in diameter and 
	was 1/4" thick. The 1/4" hole in the center of the gear was opened to 1". The 
	gear's outline was transfered to the front of the vise ensuring the screw holes 
	were well aligned. A 1 1/2" pocket was drilled with a Forstner bit to match the 
	gear's outline. The gear was then press fit into this pocket.
</p>

<p>
	The two pictures above show the pocket for the trapping brass bearing as well 
	as the installed gear bearing. You can also see the groove cut into the screw and 
	the various holes drilled in the fixed jaw.
</p>

<p>
	The stops were made from 3/4" aluminum hex. Four 1" lengths were cut off. Both 
	ends were faced and one end was reduced to 1/2" for a length of 3/4". The end 
	was chamferred and the part was deburred. This was repeated to make the four 
	stops. The partially finished version of one of the these can be clearly seen in 
	the upper left corner of the photo above.
</p>

<p>
	The large connector nut was pinned to the screw. A hole was drilled with a 0.146" 
	drill through the nut and screw. A #2 tapered reamer was then used to ream the 
	desired taper. I reamed too far and the pin drops a little too far into the hole 
	so it will need to be glued in place with Locktite. You can see the screw and nut 
	pinned in the second photo above. The nut was then drilled for the handle. The 
	nut was chucked in the four jaw chuck on the Southbend lathe. The four jaw was 
	adjusted so the center of rotation of the nut was approximately 11/16" from the 
	end and centered on a flat. A center drill was used to begin the hole. This was 
	followed by a 1/4" drill and upward to 7/8" in increments of 1/16". Some of the 
	larger drills are quite dull and need sharpened. After much frustation the hole 
	was completed and deburred with a chamfer bit and a half round file.
</p>

<p>
	The handle began as a 12" length of 7/8" dowel rod. It was chucked in the Sherline 
	lathe and the outboard end held with a live center. (Just pressed it into the wood 
	end). The most effective sandpaper to reduce the diameter was 80-grit. The dowel 
	diameter was reduced to about 0.855". This gave a nice sliding fit in the nut. This 
	is pictured below. In this picture the split bushing can also be seen.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/Sjoberg handle and nut.jpg" alt="Handle in the nut" width="2958" height="2266">

<p>
	A 3' length of 1/2" drill rod was cut into three pieces with a hacksaw. Two of 
	the pieces were 12 3/4" long. The ends of these two pieces were cleaned up and 
	chamfered with a file. One of these was slid into the left groove and further 
	into the movable jaw. It was left about 1" short of the the front side of the 
	jaw. A hole was drilled with the 0.146" drill at a height of 11/16" and 3/4" in 
	from the closing face of the movable jaw. With the hand drill I could do no more 
	than put a shallow hole into the metal rod. The rod was removed and drilled through 
	on the drill press, while holding the rod in vee blocks. While so held the tapered 
	reamer was used to open the hole to about .165". The hole in the wood was drilled 
	to full depth and reamed. Reinserting the rod allowed the taper pin to be inserted 
	with about 1/8" of pin protruding from the side of the jaw so it can be removed 
	if needed.
</p>

<p>
	Repeating this on the other side ran into a problem. The rod when inserted was 
	a very tight fit. After playing with it a bit the rod moved more freely. It was 
	pinned into place similarly to the first rod. The screw was then attached to the 
	movable jaw with the split bushing. The bushing and the threads of the screw were 
	oiled. Sliding the rods into their respective holes 
	went smoothly, but I could not align the screw with the nut inside to get it 
	started. The top was removed and it was then fairly simple to align and start the 
	screw. After reattaching the top the vise worked perfectly. The screw has too many 
	TPI, but I knew that when I decided to find one for about $10!
</p>

<p>
	The aluminum stops were completed by milling off one corner of the hex. A corner 
	was selected over a face as this led to a slightly longer (~1/8") clamping surface. 
	The stop was placed in the milling vise on the built-in vee. It was held up off 
	the jaws with two drills (removed before cutting) 0.082" & 0.081". A straight edge 
	of the stop was aligned with the front of the vise jaw by eye. About 0.180" needed 
	to be removed. This was done in increments of 0.010" with a 1/2" end mill. The final 
	cut was determined by eye and the edge was left proud of the cylinder by about 
	0.005". The top corner was chamfered with a file and the bottom edges had burrs 
	removed. The photo below shows the four completed stops.
</p>

<p>
	All that was left was to attach ends to the handle. Two reasonable pieces of scrap 
	were found. A "wheel" was cleaned up in the lathe and attached with a wood screw. 
	A hemisphere had a 1/4" hole part way through so a matching hole was drilled in the 
	end of the handle. A short piece of 1/4" dowel and some glue provided the attachment.
