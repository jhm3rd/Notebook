<p class=first>
	A box was planned to store the Dungeons & Dragons dice. The plan is to make a wooden 
	box using finger joints to put the sides together. The top will be inset, while the 
	bottom will sit in a dado cut into all four sides. The box will be cut in two to make 
	the lid. It will have hinges and a clasp. The dice will sit in an insert glued to 
	the bottom of the box. The dice will sit in sculpted holes, first drilled and then 
	chiseled to fit each shape. The inside of the box will be felted. The top will have
	foam padding under the felt to press against the dice holding them in place.
</p>

<p>
	The box will be 3&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X6" and 2&nbsp;1/2" high. Using 1/4" thick wood the 
	1" thick insert will be 3"&nbsp;X5&nbsp;1/2" or cut to fit. Some extra sides will be 
	cut to provide practice with the old table saw finger joint jig. First, the table 
	saw needs to be cleaned off. The finger joint jig was located and dusted off. After 
	reading a few old articles in Woodsmith magazine (issues 110 & 183), some scraps were 
	located and fingers cut. The first set were too loose. The jig was moved slightly away 
	from the blade, making the joints too tight to assemble. A few tries later the setup 
	was perfect. The first photo below shows the jig in place with the Simonds Si-Clone 
	blade using the Warren dado washers on setting three. The second photo shows the 
	first loose joints.
</p>

<p class="note">
	A story stick was made for the settings 1-8 on the Warren dado washers with the 
	Si-Clone blade installed. There is a lot of tearout so the interchangeable backing 
	block in the jig will be changed for one with a smaller opening. This was easily 
	accomplished by unscrewing the current backer (seen above), rotating it 180&deg;, 
	and reinstalling it.
</p>

<p>
	With the jig properly adjusted the sides were prepared. Two 6" lengths of 
	1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2&nbsp;1/2" aspen were cut followed by two 3&nbsp;1/2" lengths. The 
	fingers were cut taking care to mark the appropriate corner to be cut out of the 
	second half of a mated pair. One corner did not come out quite right (seen in the 
	back left corner below) but a little sanding evened it out. The first photo shows the 
	parts put together. A 6"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3&nbsp;1/2" piece of cherry was cut for the top. 
	A 1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/4" rabbet was cut on all four sides to sit in the box. The 
	second photo shows the box glued and clamped with the lid glued in place.

<p>
	The bottom is planned to fill about the bottom 1" of the box. A scrap of walnut was 
	cut to 3&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;6" followed by cutting a scrap of 3/4" Baltic birch 
	plywood to the same dimensions. The two were glued face-to-face as shown in the 
	photo below. (Should have cut them oversize and cut to size after glue-up as the two
	halves slide all around during clamping.)
</p>

<p>
	As the glued up bottom/insert was dry the sides were cut. The dado blade was used 
	and raised to about 1". 1/16" cuts on both sides were taken as the fencer was moved 
	in. The cutting stopped at 1/4" depth and the fit was checked. Small amounts were
	removed from both sides until the fit was easy, but not loose, a sliding fit. The 
	short ends were cut similarly, but using the miter gauge. Some thought was then 
	given to cutting the holes for the dice. The photo below shows the completed bottom 
	and the assembled box, whereas the table holds the hole dimensions for the dice.

	An attempt was made to conform to the dimensions listed in the table and then the 
	appropriate regular n-gon was drawn around the resulting circular hole. These n-gons 
	were chiseled out. A few of the pieces fit well and some pretty badly. I might try 
	to find some modeling clay to put in the holes, shape with the die, and bake the clay 
	in the oven.
</p>

<p>
	When browsing modeling clay at Michaels I found some <a href="https://www.staedtler.com/us/en/products/fimo-modeling-clay-accessories/fimoair/">air drying clay</a>.
	This was pressed into five of the holes. The appropriate die was pressed into the 
	clay and carefully removed. The excess clay above the edges of the holes was cut off 
	with the utility knife. The clay in the holes was left to dry. The website indicates 
	it should be dry in a few hours, assuming the wood surrounding it has no impact. The 
	clay was stored in a sealed plastic bag. The photo shows the wet clay in the holes.
</p>

<p>
	The box was cut in two this morning. The height was chosen so that the insert was 
	about 3/8"-1/2" below the new cut. The cut was made in two passes and left 3/8" uncut 
	between the two passes, so the box wouldn't collapse during the second cut. The excess 
	was sanded off and the edges lightly sanded. A little work with a chisel on one end 
	helped the box to seat better on the insert. The insert was glued in place as seen in 
	the photo below. The second photo shows the complete box after the clamps were removed.
</p>

<p>
	The box was sanded first with 150 grit sandpaper on an orbital sander. This was 
	followed by hand sanding with 220 grit sandpaper. Before staining the hinges were put 
	in place. 3/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1" brass hinges were found and set 1" in from the ends. 
	They were carefully marked, punched and drilled. A dark stain was used, the 4::7 
	mix of orange and brown stains used on the 
	<a href="https://jhm3rd.github.io/G&amp;G%20side%20table.html">G&G side table</a>. 
	This was applied with a rag and wiped off with a shop towel. The stain needs to dry 
	for two hours before applying the top coat.
</p>

<img class=inline src="D&Dbox/DDB stained.heic" alt="The box after sanding to 220 and staining." width="2527" height="1949">

<p>
	The bottom of the box was signed with a silver marker. The next morning lacquer was 
	applied to a test piece with the same marker, which ran. Wipe-on poly was used for 
	the finish coat, though I have had trouble with a lack of build-up on previous uses. 
	It did not smear the marker. Two coats every three hours with light sanding for the 
	remainder of the day.
</p>

<p>
	After three coats the poly dried overnight. The flocking instructions direct one to 
	seal the wood prior to applying the glue. The first step of sealing was to fill the 
	gaps between the wood and the clay. This was done with a mixture of sawdust from the 
	ash and glue. After drying the insert face was sanded with 80 grit sandpaper. The 
	inside was sealed with lacquer. While doing this the outside was also painted with 
	lacquer over the poly. The lacquer soaked right into the box! Wipe-on poly is 
	worthless! Two coats of the lacquer were brushed onto the box. The picture below 
	shows the glue/sawdust applied around the clay filled depressions.
</p>

<p>
	After allowing the lacquer to dry the inside of the box bottom was painted with 
	blue (definitely stir before use) glue, after the box edges were covered with 
	painter's tape. The box was placed in a large leaf bag and propped up at an angle. 
	Blue flocking was placed into the tube, the tube tipped hole side down and it was 
	pulled and pushed multiple times coating the glued surface in flocking as shown in 
	the picture below. A little flocking dust was brushed off of the outside of the box. 
	The flocking glue must dry for 15 to 16 hours.
</p>

<img class=inline src="D&Dbox/DDB flocked.heic" alt="The box bottom after flocking." width="2186" height="2530">

<p>
	After eighteen hours the excess flocking was shaken and lightly blown off. The dice 
	fit nicely in the provided holes as shown below. A rectangle, 1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3"&nbsp;X&nbsp;5&nbsp;1/2", 
	of foam was glued into the top using 3M spray adhesive. After sitting with a weight 
	on it for fifteen minutes a similarly sized rectangle of maroon felt was glued over 
	the foam also using spray adhesive. The photos below document the process.

<p>
	Just two remaining tasks and the box will be complete. The four hinge screws in the 
	bottom need to be shortened as seen in the photo below. Four different clasps were 
	ordered. One will be selected and installed. When the box is closed none of the dice 
	rattle around, though as can also be seen in the photo, two stick up farther than 
	the rest, pressing deep into the felt and foam.
</p>

<img class=inline src="D&Dbox/DDB near complete.heic" alt="The completed box bottom and top with hinges installed." width="2662" height="2931">

<p>
	The screws holding the hinges to the box top were removed individually. Each was 
	driven through a scrap of 1/4" thick wood with a 1/16" drilled hole. The wood was 
	held in the vise and the protruding tip of the screw was filed flat. The screw was 
	then returned to the box.
</p>

<p>
	The latch arrived yesterday, so today the box was completed.  The top hinge screws 
	were removed. The latch top was centered on the front of the box lid with the straight 
	side down using a center rule. The holes were marked with a Sharpie. 1/16" holes were 
	drilled through the box top and the top half of the latch was screwed into place. 
	The box was held together, the bottom latch aligned flat edge up and the holes marked. 
	After drilling the bottom latch was screwed into place. (These screws are shorter and 
	don't need their tips filed off.) The latch fits nicely and with the pieces in place 
	there is sufficient tension to hold the latch tight. The two photos below show off the 
	completed box.
