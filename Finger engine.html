<p class=first>
	The plans for the finger engine came from Home Shop Machinist May/June 2006, p. 58. 
	The "engine" is a finger driven lever attached to a wheel via a crank and connecting 
	rod. It was a good learning project for a complete novice as I was at the time. 
</p>

<p>
	The plan called for a 9/16" thick wheel with a central axle hole 3/4" long using 
	Loctite to attach the wheel to the axle. I decided to use a set screw. Consequently, 
	the central part of the wheel was lengthened to 1" with the extra 1/4" on the 
	outside of the wheel. This provides sufficient room to access the lock nut. Since the 
	wheel is a larger diameter than the lathe can manage as purchased a riser block 
	was purchased and this was added under the lathe spindle. The tangential tool was 
	to be used and needed to be raised to the new spindle center height. This was 
	accomplished by placing it on top of the Sherline tool post and adjusting its 
	height in the holder.
</p>

<p>
	The 3&nbsp;1/2" diameter aluminum disk was faced followed by cleaning up the rim. 
	Instead of using spokes this wheel was solid and just "decorated" with some depressions 
	cut into the face of the wheel. This was done by removing small amounts of material, 
	0.005", across the face of the lathe leaving a rim of 11/32" and the center post 
	diameter remaining was 0.40". The wheel was reversed in the three jaw chuck. The 
	opposite side had 0.095" of material removed again leaving a 0.40" diameter center 
	post and the same rim thickness. The wheel was then held in the 3-jaw chuck via the 
	longer or outside side center post. It was center drilled (#3 drill) and then drilled 
	to 1/4". The wheel was finished up with a file and sanding cloth.
</p>

<p>
	The lever was cut from 1&nbsp;1/4"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1/4" steel. It was cut roughly with 
	a hacksaw and then cleaned up with an end mill. Three of its four holes were drilled 
	and tapped. The fourth hole was drilled and reamed 0.250". A brass screw to hold the 
	lever to the column was made from a piece of brass hex in the lathe and threaded. The 
	unthreaded shaft on the screw was made 0.250" at the top end of the clearance, 
	otherwise the lever would bind.
</p>

<p>
	The shaft was made from a 2&nbsp;1/8" length of 1/4" diameter CRS. It was faced and 
	cleaned up on the lathe. Its total length was finished at 2.089". Three holes were 
	put in the wheel for decorative purposes. (The holes were fine, but the "decoration" 
	left a lot to be desired.) The holes were drilled 1&nbsp;1/16" from center. Some 
	simple geometry was used to determine their location for drilling.
</p>

<p>
	The remaining parts were straightforward and not written up in the notebook. A wooden 
	base was made to support the engine. The photo below is the only picture I have of 
	the finger engine. It was taken to the "Party House" for a gift later in 2009.
